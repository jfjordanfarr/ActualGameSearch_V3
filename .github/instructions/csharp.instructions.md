# C# Coding Conventions

- Optimize for human readability first and foremost (use the full expressiveness of spacing in the ways that veteran SQL and Powershell developers do).
- Try to avoid magic strings; compartmentalize them in appropriate configurations/constants while accepting some practical exceptions. 
- Be a showcase of the very best practices of modern C#, .NET 8+, and .NET Aspire
- (**Unique guideline for agentic development**) When a file gets longer than 500 lines, refactor. Edit tools become unreliable at longer file lengths.
