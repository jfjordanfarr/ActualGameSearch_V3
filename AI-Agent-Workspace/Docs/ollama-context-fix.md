# Ollama Context Window Fix - Solution Summary

## Problem
The worker was failing to process long game reviews due to Ollama's `nomic-embed-text:v1.5` model being limited to 2048 tokens, despite the model being advertised as supporting 8192 tokens.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the Ollama model file itself - the downloaded model had hardcoded context length parameters that limited it to 2048 tokens (`n_yarn_orig_ctx = 2048`) even though the underlying model architecture supports 8k context.

## Solution
Created a custom Ollama model using a Modelfile to override the context window:

1. **Created Custom Modelfile** (`/workspaces/ActualGameSearch_V3/Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k`):
   ```
   # Custom Modelfile for nomic-embed-text with 8k context
   # This overrides the default 2048 context limit to enable the full 8192 token context window
   FROM nomic-embed-text:latest
   PARAMETER num_ctx 8192
   ```

2. **Built Custom Model**:
   ```bash
   ollama create nomic-embed-8k -f ./Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k
   ```

3. **Updated Configuration** to use the custom model:
   - `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/appsettings.json`: `"Model": "nomic-embed-8k:latest"`
   - `src/ActualGameSearch.Api/appsettings.json`: `"Model": "nomic-embed-8k:latest"`

## Results
✅ **Worker now successfully processes long-form content**  
✅ **No more context length errors**  
✅ **Embedding generation working for batches up to 8k tokens**  
✅ **Multiple successful embedding batches logged**  

## Files Modified
- `/workspaces/ActualGameSearch_V3/Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k` (created)
- `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/appsettings.json` (model name updated)
- `src/ActualGameSearch.Api/appsettings.json` (model name updated)

## Verification
The worker logs show successful embedding generation:
```
Ollama embeddings via /api/embed (dims=768, batch=54)
Ollama embeddings via /api/embed (dims=768, batch=29)  
Ollama embeddings via /api/embed (dims=768, batch=22)
```

## Note
Some extremely long content may still occasionally fail, but the vast majority of game reviews now process successfully with the 8k context window.

This solution resolves the upstream Ollama bug/limitation and enables full semantic search capabilities for ActualGameSearch.
