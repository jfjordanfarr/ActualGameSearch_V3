# Fact-Checked, Interleaved Timeline - 2025-09-24 (Day 5)

DRAFT INITIAL SCAFFOLD — to be expanded with per-turn summaries, verbatim excerpts, line anchors, commit correlations, issue chronologies, and behavioral guidance. Day 5 re-introduces artifact creation (constitution expansion, analysis/clarification/planning cycles, research + tasks refresh, runtime validation, resilience + context-length investigations) after Day 4's methodology‑only focus.

## Quick Synopsis (High-Level Orientation)
Day 5 pivots from governance hardening to applying the refined operating model to real architectural + operational gaps: constitution expansion, cross‑artifact consistency analysis, ambiguity clarification, planning refinements, research enrichment, task realignment, end‑to‑end runtime validation (hybrid search paths), Cosmos SQL/query + emulator capability discovery, worker resilience, Ollama context sizing + batching, and portability of the embedding configuration.

### Major Arcs
- Governance Artifacts Update: Constitution expansion to encode proven methodologies (without duplicating spec/plan scope).
- Multi-Prompt Operational Cycle: Sequential execution of analyze → clarify → plan → research → tasks prompts grounded in 4-day history.
- API & Runtime Validation: Curl-based verification of search endpoints under Aspire orchestration.
- Cosmos Query & Emulator Limits: Discovery of SQL syntax / vector capability limitations inside emulator; focus shift to foundational issues first.
- Worker Resilience: Identification and mitigation of crash-on-first-error behavior when hitting external Steam APIs.
- Embedding Context & Throughput: Investigation into Nomic model context window (2k vs 8k) and batching configuration; ensuring reproducible large-context usage.
- Portability & Deployment Readiness: Ensuring solved local issues (context size, resilience) are documented and repeatable in future deployment environments.

### Key Mandates / Turning Points
- L1–L6: Initiate constitution expansion per prompt.
- L176–L359: Shift into deep cross-artifact analysis (consistency + gaps cataloguing).
- L522–L625: Clarification workflow; adoption of Option D (comprehensive error catalog aligned with Result<T> envelope).
- L673–L791: Disambiguation of search similarity vs similar games; selection of Basic scope (Option A) for an ambiguity cluster.
- L850–L931: Planning prompt execution; user updates Implementation Approach.
- L1036–L1124: Research + tasks regeneration grounded in real history.
- L1244–L1421: Runtime validation reveals Cosmos SQL query syntax issue.
- L1526: User redirects focus to foundational test-derived issues over emulator limitations.
- L2104–L2252: Worker resilience issues surfaced and confirmed resolved after fixes.
- L2272–L2304: Context window misunderstanding corrected; model supports 8k — configuration investigation continues.
- L2503–L2646: Root cause log analysis; establishing need for repeatable fix.
- L2668–L2866: Scope correction — avoid unnecessary Docker orchestration; leverage existing working approach.
- L3013–L3033: Commit preparation and staging for all accumulated changes; high-quality commit message requested (commit(s) pending in window).

---

## Turn-by-Turn (Batch 2 Draft — Turns 11–20)

Turn 11 (L1421–L1526)
- Summary: Cosmos SQL syntax error (token 'WHEN') analysis concludes emulator feature gap (CASE + VectorDistance limitations); user (L1526) redirects priority away from provisioning real Azure Cosmos toward fixing foundational runtime/test issues first.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L1421: "Cosmos DB SQL query syntax error" (assistant identification)
  - L1526: "focus on fixing the much much much more foundational issues"
- Rationale: Prevents time sink on unsupported emulator features; anchors focus on resilience and correctness.
- Commits: None yet; diagnostic only.
- Forward Reference: Worker resilience investigation begins (L1958→L2104 cluster).

Turn 12 (L1958–L2050)
- Summary: Assistant enumerates foundational issues: missing effective fallback, need for in‑memory repos, worker crash semantics, embedding batch fragility.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L1958: "These logs reveal several critical foundational issues" (thinking preface)
  - L2000–L2010 vicinity: (in‑memory repo absence recognition)
- Rationale: Establishes multi-issue remediation backlog before adding features.
- Commits: Pending (in‑memory adjustments not yet committed in window snippet).
- Forward Reference: Resilience and fallback implementation attempts (L2050+).

Turn 13 (L2050–L2136)
- Summary: Assistant attempts to create new in-memory repositories / Noop embedding service, discovers stubs already exist, pivots to replacing stub implementations and enabling emulator-aware fallback; user provides fresh worker logs at L2104 exposing crash-on-first 502.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L2104: "I re-raised the aspire apphost and immediately saw this in the worker console logs:" (logs show 502 and crash)
  - L2136: Assistant labels Issue #3 (Worker Resilience Problems).
- Rationale: Confirms theoretical issue with concrete failing behavior; drives change from fatal to tolerant per-app handling.
- Commits: Implementation work (local, pre-commit) – actual commit hash not yet produced (b92fc6e is history update only).
- Forward Reference: Exception handling refactor in Worker (L2241–L2274 trajectory).

Turn 14 (L2241–L2274)
- Summary: User confirms worker completion success (post interim fixes) yet flags persistent context length misunderstanding; assistant incorrectly assumes model hard cap 2048 then user rebuts (L2272), triggering context window deeper investigation.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L2241: "worker could run to completion" (success signal)
  - L2272: "UH NO! Absolutely not! That model is capable of 8k token context."
  - L2274: Assistant concession and plan shift.
- Rationale: Guards against premature acceptance of degraded semantic capacity; ensures full embedding fidelity pursuit.
- Commits: None yet; sets stage for model override path.
- Forward Reference: Context override attempts (L2304–L2503) and Modelfile creation later.

Turn 15 (L2304–L2503)
- Summary: User reports persistence of 2k context symptoms; assistant correlates logs (WARN requested num_ctx 8192 > n_ctx_train 2048) and initiates external research path (Ollama regression / custom Modelfile strategy) culminating in draft Modelfile placeholder mention.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L2503: "The key issue is right here in the logs:" (WARN line paraphrase)
- Rationale: Transitions from local config tweaking to upstream toolchain limitation hypothesis.
- Commits: Modelfile creation to come later (infrastructure directory not yet present in this slice).
- Forward Reference: Custom model creation workflow (L2550–L2644 and beyond).

Turn 16 (L2644–L2668)
- Summary: User requests repeatability for 8k fix; assistant defines portability plan (relocate Modelfile, setup script, potential containerization) before user pushes back (L2668) against over-engineering via Docker.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L2644: "make sure that when we deploy, we don't run into the same 2k context bug"
  - L2668: "hold up... docker setup is not necessary"
- Rationale: Reinforces scope discipline (minimal viable infrastructure vs speculative complexity).
- Commits: Infrastructure directory + script creation imminent (appears later in raw log beyond this range).
- Forward Reference: Simplified script & documentation (L2850+ region) replace container drift.

Turn 17 (L2668–L2866)
- Summary: Assistant acknowledges over-engineering; simplifies approach: direct host Ollama usage, minimal setup script (`setup-ollama-models.sh`), infrastructure README, docs updates (`ollama-context-fix.md`).
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L2866: "I got carried away with Docker orchestration..."
- Rationale: Codifies lean deployment principle; ensures reproducibility with lowest moving parts.
- Commits: Staged changes (infrastructure assets) pending commit message preparation later (L3013+).
- Forward Reference: Commit preparation (Turns 19–20) and message crafting.

Turn 18 (L2866–L3013)
- Summary: Worker + setup verification; assistant documents success (embedding batches of varying sizes, absence of context errors) and creates supporting docs; user signals readiness to commit (L3013).
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - Embedding batch examples (summarized) in assistant narrative before L3013.
  - L3013: "Let's prep a commit" (user directive).
- Rationale: Establishes observable success criteria prior to persisting changes.
- Commits: Still unstaged or newly staged pending message (b92fc6e does not include these functional changes yet— indicates further commits expected).
- Forward Reference: Commit message crafting (Turn 20).

Turn 19 (L3013–L3029)
- Summary: Assistant gathers status, stages selected paths (initial partial adds & removals); user clarifies that they manually staged everything and only want a high-quality commit message (L3029).
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L3029: "I staged everything because I want everything committed."
- Rationale: Refocuses assistant from selective staging to narrative synthesis for commit.
- Commits: Pending – commit not yet executed.
- Forward Reference: Commit message generation (Turn 20).

Turn 20 (L3029–L3033)
- Summary: Assistant inspects staged diff (multiple `git diff --cached` invocations) to craft conventional, scope-spanning commit message encapsulating infrastructure, fallback, resilience, and context expansion changes.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L3033: "Gathering staged changes to craft an accurate, high-quality commit message."
- Rationale: Ensures provenance-rich commit body aligning with Day 5 arcs.
- Commits: Commit hash not yet captured in window (will correlate once created in subsequent session if present).
- Forward Reference: Future Day 6 conversation for commit validation.

## Issue Chronicles (Initial Expansion)

### 3.1 Cosmos Query / Emulator Capability Chronicle (Expanded Draft)
- Symptom: SQL parse error `Failed to parse token 'WHEN' at position 101` (L1400–L1421 context) when executing hybrid games query.
- Discovery: Emulator lacks support for required combination of `CASE WHEN` projection + `VectorDistance` usage (emulator also earlier showed two‑arg function rejection in prior days).
- Decision: Defer production-grade hybrid query validation until real Azure Cosmos resource provisioned; prioritize resilience + correctness in in‑memory / simplified textual paths.
- Mitigation (Day 5): Reinforce fallback path; avoid premature emulator workarounds that could drift from production vector semantics.
- Next Actions:
  1. Add explicit runtime capability detection (feature flag or probe) logging: `CosmosCapabilities { vectors=false, caseExpressions=false }`.
  2. Provide developer guidance in README to expect degraded hybrid semantics under emulator.
  3. Add contract test exercising in‑memory hybrid branch ensuring deterministic score ordering sans vector distance.

### 3.2 Worker Resilience & External API Fault Handling Chronicle (Expanded Draft)
- Initial Failure: 502 from `appdetails` (app 620) causes immediate crash (L2104 logs).
- Root Cause: Throw in per-app loop with rethrowing catch block (lines referenced by assistant at L2136 cluster) aborts entire ETL.
- Remediation Direction: Convert fatal exceptions into counted, logged, skipped failures (introduce `appErrors` counter) while continuing pipeline.
- Development Mode Adjustments: Deterministic embedding fallback allowed + reduced batch pressure while preserving authentic embeddings when available.
- Observed Outcome: Worker eventually "ran to completion" (L2241) confirming non-fatal handling path effective.
- Next Hardening Steps:
  1. Introduce exponential backoff (jitter) for transient HTTP >=500 class.
  2. Distinguish permanent vs transient (e.g., 404 vs 502) for targeted skip policy.
  3. Emit structured metrics (OTel) for `appsProcessed`, `appsFailedTransient`, `appsFailedPermanent`.
  4. Add integration test simulating 502 then success to validate retry policy.

### 3.3 Embedding Context Window & Batching Chronicle (Expanded Draft)
- Problem: Model metadata shows 2048 context; attempts to force 8192 generate warn (L2304–L2503 cluster: `requested context size too large for model`).
- Investigation: External research reveals Ollama regression; solution via custom Modelfile overriding `num_ctx`.
- Implementation: `Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k` + `setup-ollama-models.sh` (simplified, no Docker) + config updates (Worker & API appsettings model name change) + verification call.
- Validation Signals: Embedding batches of varying sizes complete without context errors; absence of previous warn lines; presence of authentic latency (>300ms embedding calls).
- Portability Measures: Infrastructure script idempotently creates custom model; documentation (`ollama-context-fix.md`, infrastructure README) codifies procedure.
- Open Risks:
  1. Dependence on local Modelfile override (production must replicate before first run).
  2. Potential future upstream model variant altering dims/context; need hash pin or version note.
- Next Actions:
  1. Add health probe endpoint performing a small `embed` call (model name + reported context capability) surfaced at `/api/health/embedding`.
  2. Record expected embedding dimension & context in spec appendix for regression detection.
  3. Add smoke test that fails if fallback deterministic vectors are produced when Ollama configured.

## Governance Artifact Evolution (Day 5)

Observed edits and alignments (from staged diffs and narrative):
- Constitution: Expansion intent declared early; actual diff not captured in Day 5 commits list yet. Defer explicit mapping until commit visible.
- Research (`specs/002-we-intend-to/research.md`): Assistant planned enrichment grounded in Days 1–4 learnings; presence of staged changes not explicitly shown in tail—mark pending correlation.
- Plan/Tasks:
  - `specs/002-we-intend-to/tasks.md` described as “major rewrite to reality-aligned status” in commit proposal (Turn 24 excerpt).
  - `specs/002-we-intend-to/spec.md` updated with 2025‑09‑24 clarification block per proposal.
- Docs Added:
  - `AI-Agent-Workspace/Docs/ollama-context-fix.md` (explains 8k fix + verification)
  - `AI-Agent-Workspace/Docs/deployment-setup.md` (repeatability)
  - `infrastructure/README.md` (how to run `setup-ollama-models.sh`)

Pending confirmation upon commit:
- Exact diffs/sections modified in spec/tasks to be linked with line anchors after commit hash exists (current window shows only staged status and draft message).

## Behavioral Patterns Reinforced (Concrete Heuristics)
- Scope Control over Over‑Engineering: Prefer minimal, host‑native solutions (Aspire + native Ollama) over Docker orchestration when existing stack suffices; backtrack quickly if drift occurs.
- Capability‑Aware Fallback: Detect emulator capability gaps (vectors, CASE) and force in‑memory mode deterministically; do not half‑support advanced queries in degraded environments.
- Error Surfacing over Silent Failure: Replace broad catches with strict parsing and explicit diagnostics; preserve raw snippets (truncated) to accelerate schema adaptation.
- Probe, Cache, and Guard: For environment or backend quirks (e.g., VectorDistance arity), probe once, cache per scope (container, field), and guard against oscillation.
- Repeatability as a First‑Class Concern: When a workaround solves a local problem (8k context), convert immediately into infra scripts + docs; verify idempotence and add a smoke test.
- Empirical Validation Before Acceptance: Favor curl/test‑host runs and log-based evidence before declaring an issue resolved; capture signals/thresholds (latencies, dims, warnings absence).
