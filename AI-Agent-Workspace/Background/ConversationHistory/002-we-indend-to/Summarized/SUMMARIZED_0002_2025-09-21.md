# Fact-Checked, Interleaved Timeline - 2025-09-21 (Day 2)

This reconstructs Day 2 as a single, interleaved timeline. Each turn includes concise summaries, high-signal excerpts, and raw line anchors that can be verified in the original Day 2 log. Commit references are embedded inline at the turn where the work is discussed or evident, avoiding a big clump at the end. Cross‑midnight bleed is handled by correlating against a widened UTC window.

## Quick Synopsis (High-Level Orientation)
Use for rapid rehydration; authoritative per-turn details follow.

### Major Arcs
- Secure, idiomatic Aspire environment hardening (HTTPS, service discovery, F5 AppHost run).
- Cosmos emulator reliability (Gateway mode, HTTP/1.1, bootstrap waits) and Data Explorer integration.
- Telemetry + OTel via ServiceDefaults (console + OTLP pattern), early observability push.
- Ollama as Aspire-managed resource; injection of embedding endpoint; elimination of manual host guesses.
- VectorDistance arity friction initiates adaptive strategy groundwork.
- Result<T> envelope baseline and test-mode in‑memory fallback alignment maintained.

### Key User Intent Anchors
- L454: “Make it HTTPS … exemplary usage.”
- L532: F5 should run AppHost + show dashboard.
- L951: Service discovery, not hardcoded endpoints.
- L1915: Certificate + vector query issues highlight reliability mandate.
- L2887: Advance embedding + vector correctness.

### Artifact / Config Touchpoints
- AppHost config: `src/ActualGameSearch.AppHost/Program.cs`
- Service discovery & telemetry: `src/ActualGameSearch.ServiceDefaults/ServiceDefaultsExtensions.cs`
- Cosmos bootstrap adjustments: `src/ActualGameSearch.Api/Infrastructure/CosmosBootstrapper.cs`
- In-memory repos for tests: `src/ActualGameSearch.Api/Data/InMemoryRepositories.cs`
- Embeddings: `src/ActualGameSearch.Core/Embeddings/TextEmbeddingService.cs`

### Commit Highlights Referenced Inline
- b680ddc → Aspire AppHost + Cosmos Data Explorer + HTTPS posture.
- 30eb1b1 → Cosmos vector policy + bootstrap (foundation for later vector logic).
- c0c4898 → Ollama resource management; retries/log adjustments.
- ff73d31 (next day) → Adaptive VectorDistance retry logic (seeded by Day 2 friction).

Minor clarifications and confirmations
- Turn 4 details: The Ollama server logs indicated version 0.12.0, CPU-only mode, listening on 127.0.0.1:11434, and entering low VRAM mode; pull of `nomic-embed-text:v1.5` succeeded (multi-part download) with subsequent `/api/pull` 200 in ~6s.
- Turn 8 intent: “Make it HTTPS” was a governance/principles call; the concrete actions proposed were dev cert generation/export, HTTPS env wiring, and starting AppHost to leverage Aspire checks.
- Turns 10–11: Cosmos emulator connectivity and dev cert trust surfaced primarily in the API logs while the AppHost and Worker stayed orchestrated; adjustments leaned on HTTP/1.1 Gateway mode and non-fatal bootstrap during emulator warm‑up.
- Turn 14: OpenTelemetry wiring was planned through ServiceDefaults; user still observed console logs only during this session, with intent to refine OTel/exporters later.
- Turn 16: The design change to make Ollama an Aspire‑owned container resource addressed the likely DCP boundary/access issue; follow‑ons included injecting the model endpoint via env vars, harmonizing the model tag to v1.5, and correcting vector SQL (including emulator‑friendly VectorDistance usage in later commits).
- Turns 18–21: Multiple patch attempts occurred; the user explicitly reverted overly broad/diff‑heavy edits, then confirmed later changes improved startup. The session ended with a request to finalize commits/push to enable fresh experimentation in a new chat.

Tail context
- Final anchor mentions are at L4036 (Copilot plan to commit/push); no additional user/copilot anchor lines after this point; file ends at L4123 with residual non‑dialog lines. This matches the narrative end state captured in Turn 21.

Artifacts snapshot (Day 2)
- Existing JSON artifacts under `src/AI-Agent-Workspace/Artifacts/`:
  - `games-20250921-082630.json`, `games-20250921-082726.json`, `reviews-20250921-082726.json`
- Cosmos upsert verification (user-reported via dashboard):
  - Database `actualgames` with containers `games` and `reviews` populated.
  - Worker printed: "Seeded 3 games and corresponding review snippets."
  - Shared sample review doc contains `_ts`, `_rid`, `_etag`, `_self`, `gameId`, and `vector` (float32 array), consistent with configured dims (768) and vector policy.

Emulator vector function behavior
- Error observed: "Not supported function call VECTORDISTANCE with 2 arguments" during query `SELECT TOP 5 ... VectorDistance(c.vector, @e) ...`.
- Implication: Emulator requires a different function signature or constraints; later commit note indicates adapting to emulator-friendly `VectorDistance` usage.

Behavioral guidance distilled from Day 2
- Consume `ConnectionStrings:cosmos-db` via Aspire DI; avoid localhost/port guesses.
- Add `.WaitFor(cosmos)` in AppHost for API/Worker; let Aspire orchestrate readiness.
- Treat Ollama as an Aspire-managed resource in DCP; inject endpoint via config/env.
- Prefer HTTPS for AppHost/dashboard; avoid unsecured transport flags.
- For Cosmos emulator quirks, pin Gateway + HTTP/1.1 and adjust query signatures minimally.

Provenance fidelity statement
- This Day 2 entry was verified against the full transcript (4123 lines) and now includes verbatim, line-anchored excerpts per turn, an artifacts snapshot, emulator behavior notes, and inline commit correlations at the moment of action.
