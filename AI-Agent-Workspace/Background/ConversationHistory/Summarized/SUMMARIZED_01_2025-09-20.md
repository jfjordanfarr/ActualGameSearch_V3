- Copilot: Committed/pushed latest changes, added artifact ignores, and provided Codespaces-friendly Ollama setup steps (package or Docker) for next session.

## Key user intent quotes (high-signal excerpts)

- "I'm not about 'top 10' ... More optimally, we'll get back perhaps 20–70 games with a pileup of two or more reviews ... The user should likely be allowed to filter against that ... some kind of indication of convergence in the records that the answer is correct."
  - Convergence-first filters over large candidate pools
- "Client-side re-ranking with rich filters and larger candidate sets."
  - Keep the server simple; empower the client
- "A cheap initial preview ... run hybrid search over just the games collection, then fetch reviews in parallel ... keep APIs simple and idiomatic."
  - Games-first quick preview, then deepen
- "Emphasize open-source/public-by-default, solve-it-right-once, pragmatic and idiomatic .NET Aspire + Cosmos NoSQL + DiskANN + Ollama, and ultra-low-cost, high-accuracy game search that generalizes to product search."
  - Constitution-level guidance
- "Adjustable candidate cap, a 10k review sample cap, and default 50/50 re-rank weights."
  - Concrete defaults for UX and cost discipline
