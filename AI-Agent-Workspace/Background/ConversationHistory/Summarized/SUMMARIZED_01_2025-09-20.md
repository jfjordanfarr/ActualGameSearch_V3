9) Topic: Amend constitution for solo AI-driven workflow and ETL quality
- User: Notes solo developer reality; AI-driven development; ETL/data quality standards.

10) Topic: Create feature spec via slash prompt
- User: Describes Actual Game Search scope/components.
- Copilot: Ran feature-init; authored spec.md per template with user stories and acceptance criteria.

11) Topic: Simplify spec; prefer client-side re-ranking and rich filters
- User: Rejects entity extraction; requests larger candidate sets, filters, and client re-ranking.
- Copilot: Revised spec for client-side re-ranking, rich server-side filters, and bigger payloads grouped by game.

12) Topic: Remove “top 10” bias; add convergence filters
- User: Opposes fixed top-N view; wants convergence options (review pileups or review+game match).
- Copilot: Updated spec to remove “top 10”, add convergence filtering, and reflect “dark matter” singletons.

13) Topic: Lock in candidate cap, 10k review sample cap, 50/50 default weights
- User: Sets adjustable candidate cap, 10k review sample cap, default 50/50 re-rank weights.
- Copilot: Finalized spec with these decisions and removed open questions.

14) Topic: Merge spec work to main
- User: Requests merge to main.
- Copilot: Restored any accidental deletions, merged `002-we-intend-to` to `main`, and pushed.

15) Topic: Plan phase per prompt
- User: Asks to leverage prior research and docs to create plan.
- Copilot: Produced plan.md plus research.md, data-model.md, openapi.yaml, and quickstart.md aligned to the spec and constitution.

16) Topic: Performance policy (quality over latency)
- User: Prefers BLAST-style async if it materially improves quality; still aims for fast previews.
- Copilot: Updated plan performance goals to prefer quality-first with optional async completion while keeping quick initial results.

17) Topic: Tasks phase per prompt
- User: Requests creation of tasks.
- Copilot: Authored tasks.md (Aspire idioms, tests-first, cheap preview flow, convergence filters, and service wiring).

18) Topic: Cheap preview strategy, Aspire idioms, TDD balance, and interfaces
- User: Suggests games-first preview; queries idiomatic structure; warns not to reinvent Microsoft abstractions.
- Copilot: Updated tasks to split endpoints, use Aspire solution shape, align with Microsoft.Extensions.AI, and keep TDD pragmatic.

19) Topic: Endpoint split confirmation and timing
- User: Approves separate endpoints; defers contract changes until /implement.
- Copilot: Adjusted tasks accordingly and prepared for implementation.

20) Topic: Implement scaffolding
- User: Provides current tree and starts /implement.
- Copilot: Scaffolded solution (Api, Core, Worker, ServiceDefaults, AppHost), minimal API + static frontend, and built successfully.

21) Topic: Commit/push, then proceed; start basic contracts/tests
- User: Confirms build success; asks to commit/push and continue.
- Copilot: Committed/pushed; added contract tests and initial grouped endpoint; began shaping endpoints.

22) Topic: Use Result<T> envelope
- User: Requests a `Result<T>` pattern for API responses.
- Copilot: Implemented `Result<T>` in Core; updated endpoints and tests to assert `{ ok, data|error }` shape; tests passed.

23) Topic: What’s next; checkpoint and inventory
- User: Prefers commit/push and re-evaluation against plan; shares workspace tree.
- Copilot: Committed; recommended next steps (typed DTOs, integration tests, OpenAPI updates, service scaffolding, AppHost resources).

24) Topic: Approve plan; proceed
- User: Approves and echoes next steps for resilience to summarization.
- Copilot: Added typed response models, updated API to typed `Result<T>`, added integration tests, and updated OpenAPI; all tests green.

25) Topic: Commit/push; T012 embeddings via Microsoft abstractions
- User: Approves; emphasizes using Microsoft Docs and Extensions.AI.
- Copilot: Committed; implemented `IEmbeddingGenerator`-based embedding service with Ollama; DI wired; tests green.

26) Topic: Commit/push; T013 hybrid ranker
- User: Approves and praises work.
- Copilot: Implemented `HybridRanker` with unit tests and deterministic tie-breakers; tests green.

27) Topic: T014 Cosmos emulator + Data Explorer in Aspire
- User: Requests emulator usage and mentions Data Explorer UX.
- Copilot: Upgraded AppHost to Aspire SDK; enabled Cosmos emulator with Data Explorer; wired API via `AddAzureCosmosClient`; scaffolded repositories.

28) Topic: Proceed with bootstrap + vector query
- User: Approves direction.
- Copilot: Added Cosmos bootstrapper to create DB/containers with vector policy/index; implemented initial vector/text queries; guarded DI; tests/build green; pushed.

29) Topic: Use real data + embeddings; “prove it”
- User: Wants real Steam metadata/reviews; embedding via Ollama; provides prior Python dataclasses for shape inspiration; asks to prove query path.
- Copilot: Implemented Worker as a seeding tool fetching real Steam data and reviews, generating embeddings via Ollama HTTP (with deterministic fallback), upserting to Cosmos (or writing artifacts), and running a smoke vector query.

30) Topic: Commit/push and pause; Ollama setup next time
- User: Requests commit/push and notes future Ollama setup (see background doc).
- Copilot: Committed/pushed latest changes, added artifact ignores, and provided Codespaces-friendly Ollama setup steps (package or Docker) for next session.
