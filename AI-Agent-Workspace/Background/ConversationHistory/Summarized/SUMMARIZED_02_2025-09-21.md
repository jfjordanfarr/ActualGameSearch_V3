Below are brief entries for each user prompt and AI response pair captured from the unabridged conversation log for 2025-09-21.

1) Topic: Day-1 summary request and context kickoff
- User: Asked to generate concise pairwise summaries for 2025-09-20 into `SUMMARIZED_01_2025-09-20.md`.
- Copilot: Planned, read the raw log, wrote a numbered summary file, and confirmed completion.

2) Topic: Start Ollama and test the Worker
- User: Installed/served Ollama in Codespaces and pulled `nomic-embed-text:v1.5`; asked if ready to test the Worker.
- Copilot: Attempted to run the Worker to seed data (without first verifying expected artifacts/paths).

3) Topic: Hydrate with repo context and consider AppHost
- User: Advised reading the code before running; suggested starting the Aspire AppHost and shared the workspace tree.
- Copilot: Read key files (Worker, API, AppHost, repos, bootstrapper, artifacts) and planned to run AppHost so Cosmos + service discovery are available.

4) Topic: Enforce HTTPS and proper Aspire patterns
- User: Rejected unsecured transport flags; insisted on HTTPS and exemplary usage.
- Copilot: Generated a dev HTTPS cert, tried secure env vars, iterated on AppHost dashboard setup, and added an HTTPS launch profile.

5) Topic: Make F5 run AppHost + open the dashboard
- User: Manually ran the AppHost successfully and asked to wire F5 and show the Aspire dashboard.
- Copilot: Added VS Code `launch.json` and `tasks.json` so F5 runs AppHost (HTTPS), launched it, and documented dashboard/API/Cosmos URLs and usage.

6) Topic: Cosmos emulator connection failures
- User: Shared API/Worker exceptions (HTTP/2 premature end), plus emulator logs.
- Copilot: Switched Cosmos SDK usage to Gateway + HTTP/1.1, made API bootstrap non-fatal on failure, rebuilt, and re-ran.

7) Topic: Use Aspire service discovery, not manual endpoints
- User: Pushed back on guessing endpoints; emphasized Aspire service discovery.
- Copilot: Broadened Worker exception handling/retries during Cosmos init to avoid hard failures while proceeding.

8) Topic: How service discovery wiring actually works for Cosmos
- User: Posted Worker `Program.cs` and asked how env/config are sourced and if Aspire SD is the mechanism.
- Copilot: Explained `.WithReference(cosmos)` injects `ConnectionStrings:cosmos-db`; removed localhost/env fallbacks; switched API/Worker to `AddAzureCosmosClient("cosmos-db")`, added `.WaitFor(cosmos)`, and clarified the dev-cert warning impact.

9) Topic: No data yet; add observability and DI for Cosmos
- User: Reported quiet logs and no upserts; requested better observability.
- Copilot: Wired OpenTelemetry via ServiceDefaults (OTLP + console timestamps), adopted DI-based `CosmosClient` in Worker, and logged the target Cosmos endpoint for verification.

10) Topic: First end-to-end success (with follow-ups)
- User: Confirmed resources waited for Cosmos; API showed forwarded Cosmos endpoint; Worker fetched Steam app details and reviews; Ollama `/api/embeddings` returned 404 (path/tag mismatch); vector SQL failed (`VECTORDISTANCE` signature). Despite that, documents appeared in Cosmos Explorer with vectors. (No AI reply yet in this thread.)

## Key user intent quotes (high-signal excerpts)

- "Make it HTTPS. We are here to be exemplary of proper usage of the tooling. If we see them telling us 'no, that's not secure', our answer should not be 'do it anyway'."  
  - Security and idiomatic Aspire usage over shortcuts
- "Use Aspire service discovery, not manual endpoints."  
  - Configuration via `.WithReference(...)` and `AddAzureCosmosClient("cosmos-db")`
- "I want to see the Aspire dashboard and F5 should run the AppHost."  
  - Developer ergonomics: one-key run with full observability
