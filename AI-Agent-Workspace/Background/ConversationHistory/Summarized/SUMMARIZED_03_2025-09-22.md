# Conversation Summary — 2025-09-22

Below are brief entries for each user prompt and AI response pair captured from the unabridged conversation log for 2025-09-22.

1) Topic: Day-2 summary request; prep for fresh AppHost run
- User: Asked to create the day-2 summary into `SUMMARIZED_02_2025-09-21.md`; will then share a fresh AppHost run.
- Copilot: Read the raw log and wrote the summary file; confirmed completion and readiness for AppHost logs.

2) Topic: Fresh AppHost run; Worker using fallback embeddings; vector query failing
- User: Reported that first run timed out waiting for resources; second run succeeded but Worker likely used fallback embeddings (sparse vectors), and Cosmos vector SQL errored on `VECTORDISTANCE` arity.
- Copilot: Planned to inspect AppHost/Worker wiring and propose precise fixes (service discovery for Ollama, correct embeddings path/tag, correct vector SQL signature).

3) Topic: Wire Ollama via service discovery; improve resilience and OTLP; fix vector SQL
- User: Provided detailed logs for Worker, API, Cosmos, and Ollama; asked for idiomatic Aspire telemetry and structured logging.
- Copilot: Updated AppHost to reference Ollama and pass discovery-friendly endpoints; enhanced ServiceDefaults with Service Discovery and OTLP exporters; adjusted Worker to use service discovery for Ollama and moved vector query toward emulator-supported signature.

4) Topic: Rebuild, rerun, and confirm behavior; adjust API repository query
- User: Shared follow-up logs showing persistent vector SQL arity errors and inconsistent embeddings calls.
- Copilot: Updated `CosmosReviewsRepository` to use 3-arg `VectorDistance` with configurable distance function; rebuilt and restarted the AppHost.

5) Topic: Persistent arity flips; adopt adaptive query strategy
- User: Noted repeated pattern of arity rejections (2-arg vs 3-arg) across runs; asked for a reliable solution.
- Copilot: Implemented adaptive runtime strategy: try 3-arg first, on 400/500 NotSupported fallback to 2-arg; applied to both Worker probe and API repository.

6) Topic: Codify the approach; centralize helper and config override
- User: Expressed skepticism about emulator version variance; asked to stop oscillating and build forward to full real embeddings and richer data.
- Copilot: Extracted `CosmosVectorQueryHelper` in Core to auto-detect and cache supported form per container; refactored API and Worker to use it; added optional config override for deterministic behavior.

7) Topic: Build succeeded; make tests pass under in-memory mode
- User: Posted green build output.
- Copilot: Ran tests; added in-memory repositories and no-op embedder for test runs, tightened Program.cs conditional to avoid Cosmos in tests, and re-ran tests.

8) Topic: Status and next steps
- User: Reiterated project priorities (idiomatic Aspire, emulated resources when possible, avoid secrets), and expectation to reach real `nomic-embed-text:v1.5` embeddings with complete reviews.
- Copilot: Confirmed adaptive vector helper is shared and used; prepared to extend Worker to paginate Steam reviews and ensure true Ollama embeddings via `/api/embed` with dims=768, then validate in Cosmos Data Explorer.

## Key user intent quotes (high-signal excerpts)

- "Make it HTTPS ... be exemplary of proper usage of the tooling."
- "Use Aspire service discovery, not manual endpoints."
- "I still do not see any distributed traces at all, or structured logging. ... we’re not leveraging dotnet aspire idiomatically."
- "There is no need to keep bouncing back and forth on this. We should be at the point now where we have real nomic-text-embed:v1.5 embeddings for real games, full unabridged reviews, all that good stuff."
- "Prefer to get by on emulated resources ... as soon as real resources get involved, logs almost invariably end up spilling something sensitive."

# Day 3 Summary (2025-09-22) — DRAFT

This is a temporary lightweight summary; the authoritative provenance record will be `FACTCHECKED_Interleaved_03_2025-09-22.md` (currently scaffolded, expansion in progress).

Early Thematic Highlights
1. Recurrent Cosmos `VectorDistance` arity instability → adaptive probing + cached per-container form (progression toward helper + eventual gating logic refinements captured in later commits `ff73d31`, `4d9378a`).
2. Transition from deterministic fallback embeddings to confirmed real Ollama embeddings after orchestrated reruns (user explicitly reports “embeddings were real this time” once Aspire resource sequencing stabilized).
3. Review ingestion maturation: shift from minimal snippets to full multilingual (language=all) fetch, cursor pagination intention, and quality gating (unique-word threshold, Steam purchase filter, minimum qualified review counts, staged game upsert) culminating in commit `4d9378a`.
4. DTO resilience & parsing strictness: handling polymorphic `weighted_vote_score` (number|string), flexible `success` shape, tolerant genre/category `id` (string or number) with skip+diagnostics instead of silent failure.
5. Error philosophy pivot: explicit celebration of surfaced errors (“Hooray! Actual errors! … commit this to memory”) leading to removal of silent fallbacks and clearer logs.
6. Embeddings pipeline hardening: batching, configurable `num_ctx`, HTTP timeout knob, deterministic fallback toggle, and persistent runtime arity detection retained (`ff73d31`, `4d9378a`).
7. Seed completeness pursuit: eliminating infinite loops and zero-seed regressions, achieving simultaneous games + reviews embeddings; preparing ground for patch notes ingestion.
8. Minimal UI affordance (`wwwroot/search.html`) introduced for smoke testing hybrid and review search endpoints.

Pending Detailed Expansion
- Full per-turn line-anchored summaries
- Inline commit hash placement at first intent expression
- Specialized chronologies (vector arity saga, ingestion & gating evolution, embeddings pipeline changes, error philosophy)
- Artifacts snapshot (post-hardening run: counts, sample logs, config knobs)
