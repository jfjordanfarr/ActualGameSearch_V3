Planned Structure
1. Overview of Day 3 thematic arcs (embedding reliability, vector arity resolution, seeding completeness, data quality gating, DTO resilience, batching + performance knobs, review ingestion correctness, error surface philosophy).
2. Turn-by-turn section:
   - For each user/copilot exchange: summary, rationale, raw line anchors, verbatim high-signal excerpts, inline commit correlation (only where action manifested in codebase), and forward references if the resolution occurs later.
3. VectorDistance Arity Investigation Chronicle (consolidated): timeline of every probe/error/adaptive strategy decision with anchors.
4. Steam Data Quality & Review Ingestion Evolution: parameters shifts, gating logic introduction, DTO normalization (weighted_vote_score, genres/categories id flexibility) with anchors and commit mapping.
5. Embeddings Pipeline Hardening: fallback detection, batching introduction, `num_ctx`, timeout adjustments, deterministic fallback knob—anchored to lines + commits `ff73d31`, `4d9378a`.
6. Error Philosophy Shift: from silent fallback to explicit surfaced errors; anchor lines where user mandates permanent memory of that principle.
7. Artifacts Snapshot: post-hardening run state (counts of games/reviews, presence of embeddings, sample error logs) with anchored excerpts.
8. Behavioral Guidance Distillation: actionable Copilot operating heuristics derived from Day 3 (probing patterns, DTO resilience approach, commit staging practices, seeding guardrails, provenance discipline).
9. Verification Appendix: reproducible shell snippets (wc -l, grep anchors, git log commands) and any diagnostic queries used.

Next Steps to Complete This File
- Enumerate all dialog turns (scan all speaker anchors) and partition into coherent turns (merging consecutive same-speaker technical elaborations).
- Extract verbatim excerpts (<=6 lines each) capturing: problem statement, hypothesis, action, result, follow-up.
- Map each implemented change to the earliest turn where intent was stated; embed commit hash inline at that turn.
- Produce specialized chronicles (sections 3–6) after raw turn enumeration to avoid duplication.
- Run a final pass to ensure every commit in the window is referenced at least once where semantically relevant, and no orphaned significant turns lack summary.

Status: scaffold created; expansion pending.

## Quick Synopsis (High-Level Orientation)
Day 3 centers on stabilizing hybrid search correctness under real embeddings and authentic review ingestion while eliminating silent failures.

### Major Arcs
- VectorDistance arity instability → adaptive detection + caching.
- Transition from fallback/dummy embeddings to real Ollama model usage (dimensionality + latency awareness).
- Review ingestion expansion: multilingual, gating on minimum reviews, schema normalization.
- Error philosophy pivot: surface parse/deserialization anomalies rather than silently drop.
- DTO resilience: polymorphic field handling (e.g., `weighted_vote_score`, flexible genre/category IDs).
- Embedding pipeline hardening: batching, possible `num_ctx` tuning, timeouts, deterministic fallback toggle.
- UI discovery stub + manual smoke workflow via `search.html`.

### Key User Mandates
- L3617–L3650: Infinite loop detection (probe logic guard).
- L4305+: Zero-seed regression investigation required.
- L4717: Permanent rule—expose errors, do not mask them.

### Commit Highlights (Window Spanning Into 09-23)
- ff73d31 → Adaptive VectorDistance retry; test-host in-memory enforcement.
- 4d9378a → Ingestion + embeddings hardening, gating, DTO normalization, UI scaffold, logs.

### Artifact Touchpoints
- Adaptive helper: `src/ActualGameSearch.Core/Services/CosmosVectorQueryHelper.cs`
- Worker ingestion & DTO updates: `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/`
- API hybrid routing & bootstrap adjustments: `src/ActualGameSearch.Api/`
- UI preview: `src/ActualGameSearch.Api/wwwroot/search.html`

- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L49–L52: Timeout + fallback suspicion description
  - L122–L125: Vector query failure (2-arg not supported) diagnostic header lines
- Problem Statement: Fallback deterministic embeddings retained; vector search failing → hybrid retrieval blocked.
- Hypothesis (implicit): Worker still not using real Ollama path; SQL signature mismatch with emulator policy.
- Commit Correlation: Provides raw symptoms resolved in steps leading to adaptive arity logic (`ff73d31`) and ingestion hardening (`4d9378a`).

- Commit Correlation: Justifies introduction of adaptive + cached arity detection (`ff73d31`).

Turn 6
- Lines: Copilot L649–L656
- Summary: Proposes adaptive query strategy: attempt 3-arg first, fallback to 2-arg on NotSupported / 500; apply to Worker + API; rebuild & validate.
- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - L649–L652: Adaptive arity strategy statement
- Design Notes: Runtime probe avoids hardcoding emulator quirks; aims idempotence and forward compatibility.
- Risk: Without caching, repeated fallback attempts could cause inefficiency → addressed later.
- Commit Correlation: Strategy realized in `ff73d31` (auto-retry logic) and refined pre-`4d9378a` (caching, guardrails).

Turn 7
- Lines: User L669–L672
- Summary: Requests historical scan for “2-argument” vs “3-argument” to understand root confusion and prevent oscillation.
- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - L669: "Why has this tripped us up more than once?"
- Rationale: Institutional memory capture to reduce thrash; provenance-driven stability.

- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - L740–L743: Dotnet 9 conjecture text
- Rationale: Considers systemic platform differences as alternate cause to SQL signature issues.
- Decision Heuristic: Continue adaptive solution without premature upgrade (cost vs immediate value).
- Commit Correlation: Upgrade deferred; adaptive logic path chosen instead (`ff73d31`).

Turn 10
- Lines: Tool marker L907 + User L1066 + Copilot L1068–L1102 (combined as single iterative cycle pre-build/test) + User L1080
- Summary: Iteration control: user prompts continuation; Copilot transitions into patch application and test execution plan; user supplies build output; Copilot commits to running full test suite for end-to-end validation of search endpoints + repository wiring.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L1066: "@agent Continue: \"Continue to iterate?\""
  - L1080: Build output intro line
  - L1102: "I’ll run the test suite..."
- Rationale: CI-like loop ensuring changes (including forthcoming adaptive logic) don’t regress existing functionality.

---

## Turn-by-Turn (Expanded - Batch 2)

Turn 11
- Lines: User L1210–L1224 (environment reset + workspace census snippet), Copilot L1379 (test run output notice)
- Summary: User proactively resets environment (closes forwarded ports, fresh terminal) to eliminate confounding variables before further validation; Copilot confirms tests were run (`dotnet test` invocation aligns to prior plan in Turn 10).
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L1210: "I suspect that leftover old processes might be interfering... closed every forwarded port..."
  - L1379: "Ran terminal command: dotnet test ..."
- Rationale: Ensures deterministic baseline before assessing embedding/vector changes; reinforces test-first loop.
- Commit Correlation: Preconditions for test-friendly adjustments later embodied in `ff73d31` (in-memory repos under Test env).

Turn 12
- Lines: User L1441–L1457 (expected behavior request), Copilot L1446–L1455 (lifecycle outline)
- Summary: User requests a concrete description of what to expect during first and subsequent AppHost runs (given known timeouts on initial resource spin-up); Copilot responds with plan to inspect Worker/AppHost and summarize seeding, embeddings, vector policies.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L1441: "I'm ready to test next, but I want to have a good overall idea of what you expect the application to do once I boot up that apphost..."
  - L1446: "I'll quickly inspect the Worker and AppHost startup code... summarize expected behaviors and outcomes."
- Rationale: Establishes observable contract (what 'good' looks like) → critical for later gating and telemetry assertions.
- Commit Correlation: Documentation / README expectations later referenced in `ff73d31` (first-run expectations captured) and extended in `4d9378a` (data quality gating behaviors).

Turn 13
- Lines: User L1627–L1633
- Summary: User confirms first successful run with "real" embeddings after running Aspire twice (warm-up then full run) and highlights improved speed once resources stabilized.
- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - L1627: "WOW! The embeddings were real this time!... It was very very cool to watch!"
- Impact: Confirms transition from deterministic fallback vectors (sparse zeros) to genuine model embeddings; baseline established for performance + correctness improvements.
- Commit Correlation: Validates earlier resource orchestration and Ollama management work (`c0c4898`) and sets success baseline for subsequent hardening (`ff73d31`).

Turn 14
- Lines: Copilot L2249–L2259
- Summary: Proposes improvement: Worker smoke vector search auto-retries alternative `VectorDistance` form if Cosmos errors; update README with first-run expectations; commit & push.
- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - L2249: "I’m going to make a small improvement to the Worker’s smoke vector search to auto-retry..."
- Rationale: Early concrete step toward robust adaptive arity logic; reduces manual intervention while documenting expected states.
- Commit Correlation: Realized in `ff73d31` (auto-retry, first-run expectations docs) with later caching refinements preceding `4d9378a`.

Turn 15
- Lines: User L2392–L2399 (snippet fallback description), Copilot L2421–L2429 (removal/enrichment plan)
- Summary: User underscores current fallback when Steam returns zero reviews (synthetic snippets) and implies need for authentic data over placeholders; Copilot commits to locating fallback, removing snippet substitution, enriching schema, and adding game vector support.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L2392: "> When Steam returns zero review items (despite a 200), the Worker falls back to “review-like snippets”..."
  - L2421: "I'll scan the current Worker, API models, and bootstrapper to identify where fallback behavior exists..."
- Rationale: Shifts ingestion posture from synthetic augmentation to authenticity-first; sets stage for gating.
- Commit Correlation: Replacement & enrichment appear in `4d9378a` (quality gating & real review ingestion) and earlier partial adjustments in `ff73d31`.

Turn 16
- Lines: User L2525–L2534 (lossy autosummarization caution), Copilot L2539–L2546 (TODOs persistence plan)
- Summary: User notes large-thought truncation (UI length limit) and mandates persistence of goals via durable TODOs to survive autosummarization; Copilot commits to adding a persistent TODOs markdown with data-quality commitments.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L2525: "Please explore the foundational markdown docs... USE YOUR TODOS tool to persist goals across lossy autosummarization steps."
  - L2539: "I'll run a full build and test... then I'll add a persistent TODOs markdown..."
- Rationale: Institutionalizes resilience against context window loss; improves long-horizon coherence.
- Commit Correlation: History/documentation update commits (`84df16d`) and gating logic commit (`4d9378a`) reference sustained goals.

Turn 17
- Lines: User L2669–L2677 (current review fetch params + API key mention), Copilot L2690–L2702 (scan & implement plan), User L2718–L2719 (authorization to proceed), Copilot L2720–L2729 (detailed implementation plan)
- Summary: User enumerates current review fetch approach (language=english, public endpoint) and invites richer multi-language/API-key path; Copilot plans shift to language=all, adds hybrid games search endpoint (vector + title), in-memory + Cosmos implementations, and data dictionary doc; user approves; Copilot formalizes action plan.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L2669: "> We currently use the public appreviews endpoint... language=english..."
  - L2720: "I'll update the Worker to fetch all languages, add a hybrid games search method..."
- Rationale: Expands corpus breadth & hybrid retrieval expressiveness; sets foundation for gating thresholds.
- Commit Correlation: Implemented in `4d9378a` (multilingual ingestion, hybrid endpoint, config knobs) and partially in `ff73d31` (test infra groundwork).

Turn 18
- Lines: User L2925–L2932 (authentic discovery philosophy), Copilot L3114–L3116 (code search output)
- Summary: User stresses focus on authentic discovery (not broad scraping) reinforcing ethical scope constraints; Copilot continues model/DTO file reconnaissance for changes.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L2925: "We are indeed *not* scraping all of Steam. We are deliberatively trying to find all that which is authentic..."
  - L3114: "Searched for files matching `**/src/ActualGameSearch.Core/Models/**`, 5 matches"
- Rationale: Narrows design criteria influencing gating (quality > volume) and documentation framing.
- Commit Correlation: Philosophy reflected in review gating + staged upsert logic (`4d9378a`).

Turn 19
- Lines: User L3347–L3350 (UI stub request), Copilot L3351–L3353 (reads existing index), User L3452–L3455 (asks next steps), Copilot L3476–L3482 (reads CosmosBootstrapper)
- Summary: User requests a minimal `search.html` to demo hybrid + review endpoints; Copilot inspects existing `index.html` then dives into bootstrapper for necessary wiring context before implementing; user asks for next actionable chunk; Copilot reading continues.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L3347: "> Add a tiny wwwroot/search.html to demo the hybrid and review endpoints..."
  - L3476: "Read .../CosmosBootstrapper.cs"

- Summary: Infinite loop in Worker surfaces (review/game ingestion stall); Copilot targets vector arity probe logic—adds per container/field caching and guards to stop repeated toggling; user confirms persistent symptoms plus missing review ingestion; Copilot expands plan (fieldPath in cache key, one-shot probing, logging). Accidental AppHost shutdown acknowledged.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L3617: "Whoa, I ran the apphost but I saw we entered an infinite loop in the worker."
  - L3651: "I’m going to inspect the vector helper... cache the probed form..."
  - L3769: "...doing many calls for embeddings before starting to get stuck in that same loop again..."
  - L3774: "I’ll inspect the API repository code... add guardrails..."
  - L3786: "...update the vector arity helper to include `fieldPath`... one-shot probing guards..."
- Root Cause (Implied): Non-cached or oscillating arity probing causing repeated retries combined with ingestion gating preconditions not met.
- Resolution Approach: Deterministic one-shot detection, keyed by (container, fieldPath), guard against repeated toggling, explicit logging.
- Commit Correlation: Consolidated into hardening changes later captured in `4d9378a` (final gating + stable probing) with initial adaptive logic in `ff73d31`.

---

## Turn-by-Turn (Expanded - Batch 3)

Turn 21
- Lines: ~L4305–L4370 (first zero-seed run culminating in line 4369) + earlier fetch/skip diagnostics
- Summary: First explicit post-hardening run ends with `Seeded 0 games and corresponding reviews.` (L4369) despite numerous successful `appdetails` + embedding calls, revealing that gating logic executed but yielded no persisted entities.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L4369: "2025-09-23T00:51:35 Seeded 0 games and corresponding reviews."  
  - Prior lines show alternating `appdetails` + embeddings calls with no review write logs.
- Rationale / Impact: Establishes the observable symptom requiring historical search + ingestion pipeline introspection; confirms that silent fallback no longer masks zero-ingestion.
- Commit Correlation: Precedes fixes in `4d9378a` (review gating adjustments) and DTO normalization enabling actual persistence.

Turn 22
- Lines: ~L4371–L4445 (second run ends line 4438)
- Summary: Second execution again terminates with zero seeded (L4438), increasing confidence issue is systemic (parsing/gating) not transient transport failure.
- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - L4438: "2025-09-23T00:59:06 Seeded 0 games and corresponding reviews."
- Rationale: Reproducibility drives shift from heuristic speculation to transcript-driven archaeology of prior successful patterns (games vs reviews embeddings at different times).
- Commit Correlation: Motivates upcoming strict parsing adjustments (later part of `4d9378a`).

Turn 23
- Lines: User directive around L4490–L4510 ("We will need to do searches ... seriously, actually perform the searches")
- Summary: User mandates exhaustive historical log search (Raw + Summarized) for previous ingestion success cases; emphasizes that prior partial victories (games or reviews separately) must be reconciled to achieve combined ingestion.
- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - L4498 vicinity (paraphrased anchor): user insists on genuine search over superficial pattern recall.
- Rationale: Elevates methodology from reactive patches to provenance-guided differential analysis; sets expectation for explicit cross-day synthesis.
- Commit Correlation: Drives structured archaeology steps informing durable parsing fixes (rolled into `4d9378a`).

Turn 24
- Lines: ~L4550 (third zero-seed termination) and adjacent preceding fetch logs
- Summary: Third iteration again: `Seeded 0 games ...` (L4550), solidifying failure signature prior to strict JSON parsing enablement.
- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - L4550: repetition of zero-seed termination.
- Impact: Justifies escalation to remove any residual silent catch within pagination.
- Commit Correlation: Preconditions to error-surfacing changes before DTO correction.

Turn 25
- Lines: ~L4715–L4725 (User celebrates surfacing of real errors after strict parsing) & earlier parse failure lines L4759–L4761, L4788–L4789
- Summary: After removing silent fallbacks, real deserialization errors emerge for `weighted_vote_score` numeric token (L4761, L4789); user explicitly reinforces principle: surfacing failures > plausible success illusions.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L4761: "JsonException: ... Path: $.reviews[0].weighted_vote_score"
  - L4789: same exception after rerun.
  - User around L4717–L4722: praise for error visibility ("Hooray! Actual errors! ... commit this to memory!").
- Rationale: Marks cultural pivot to “fail fast with raw snippet” doctrine enabling accurate schema adaptation.
- Commit Correlation: Directly precedes DTO variant updates (`weighted_vote_score` normalization) in `4d9378a` (or follow-on commit sequence—hash mapping to be updated if new commit added).

Turn 26
- Lines: Copilot remediation plan lines L4819–L4864
- Summary: Copilot outlines fix: accept numeric or string forms by changing `weighted_vote_score` to tolerant representation (`JsonElement?`) and normalizing during mapping; reiterates strict parsing retention.
- Verbatim Excerpts:
  - L4856: "Steam’s `weighted_vote_score` is sometimes a number, not a string."
  - L4861–L4863: Implementation notes (field now `JsonElement?`, normalize both legacy + paginated paths).
- Rationale: Implements polymorphic value handling without reintroducing broad try/catch swallowing.
- Commit Correlation: Incorporated into ingestion hardening commit (`4d9378a`) or subsequent patch commit (if separate, reference to follow once hash known—placeholder accepted pending git log update).

Turn 27
- Lines: Post-fix run logs culminating in large-scale embeddings (lines after L4864 up to ~L4975) — improved ingestion performance; slower per-embedding latency indicative of real model computation vs synthetic fallback.
- Summary: System now performs multi-minute ingestion with legitimate embeddings, confirming fix unblocked review persistence path prior to later crash on malformed `appdetails` entry.
- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - Representative line: embedding POST 200 with ~0.5–1.2s latencies (e.g., earlier 595ms / 1280ms examples) showing substantial compute.
- Rationale: Validates authenticity of pipeline (model loaded, vector dims=768 consistent with Ollama metadata) and supports divergence from prior “fast zero-vector” fallback signature.
- Commit Correlation: Execution evidence for correctness of earlier DTO + parsing adjustments.

Turn 28
- Lines: Malformed appdetails error ~L4985–L5005 (appId 2693590) where pipeline aborts with `Malformed appdetails payload`.
- Summary: Ingestion halts on structural anomaly in `appdetails` response for a specific app; strict fail-fast behavior functions as designed, preventing silent insertion of partial or corrupt entities.
- Verbatim Excerpt:
  - L4989 vicinity: "ETL failed for app 2693590: Malformed appdetails payload for app 2693590"
- Rationale: Demonstrates consistent application of surfaced error philosophy across both reviews and game metadata ingestion.
- Commit Correlation: Suggests need for next refinement: selective quarantine / skip-with-diagnostic for isolated malformed appdetails while preserving progress (candidate enhancement beyond `4d9378a`).

## Specialized Chronicle: Error Philosophy Pivot

Scope: Consolidates the transition from silent fallback ingestion to explicit, truncation-aware error surfacing for Steam reviews and appdetails.

Key Anchors:
- Silent zero-seed runs: L4369, L4438, L4550 (symptom without causal visibility).
- Mandate to search history: L4498 block (methodology shift toward provenance-driven fix).
- First surfaced parse failures: L4761, L4789 (numeric `weighted_vote_score` mismatch).
- User principle assertion: L4717–L4722 ("Allowing errors is better than failing silently").
- Copilot normalization plan: L4856–L4863.

Resolution Mechanics:
1. Removed broad catch around review pagination; errors now bubble with raw JSON snippet (truncated).
2. DTO schema adjusted for polymorphic fields (numeric|string) — started with `weighted_vote_score`.
3. Retained strong precondition checks (`success == 1`), rejecting partial or shape-shifted payloads.
4. Adopted deterministic logging vocabulary: `ETL failed for app <id>:` vs ambiguous skip.
5. Maintained gating logic (min reviews) but guaranteed it acts on parsed data, not suppressed exceptions.

Benefits:
- Eliminated epistemic ambiguity (zero review cause now explicit).
- Accelerated schema adaptation loop (minutes vs speculative multi-run guessing).
- Provided durable pattern for future heterogenous fields (`review`, `author.playtime_forever`, potential localization fields).

Forward Improvements (Not Yet Implemented):
- Introduce triage classify: (SchemaVariant | TransientNetwork | LegitEmpty) for selective skip with metrics.
- Add metrics counters: `steam.review.parse_failures`, `steam.appdetails.malformed`, `ingestion.skipped.minReviews`.
- Provide admin endpoint `/admin/etl/failures/recent` exposing last N failure diagnostics.

## Specialized Chronicle: DTO & Schema Resilience Evolution

Problem Sequence:
1. Initial DTO mismatch (undeclared numeric variant) caused silent swallow → zero seeded (L4369/L4438/L4550).
2. Strict parsing exposed first concrete mismatch at `weighted_vote_score` (L4761, L4789).
3. Rapid adaptation: polymorphic field handling + normalization (L4856–L4863).
4. Subsequent run uncovered distinct failure class: malformed `appdetails` (L4989 vicinity) — indicates multi-surface schema variability.

Techniques Applied:
- Raw body capture with capped length to prevent log flooding.
- Use of `JsonElement?` to defer interpretation until controlled normalization phase.
- Dedicated normalization branch converting number → invariant-culture string.
- Early semantic assertions: `success==1`, non-null `reviews` array.

Design Pattern (Codify):
- Phase 1: Raw acquisition (HTTP 200/JSON assumption only).
- Phase 2: Structural gate (`success==1`; required top-level nodes present).
- Phase 3: Lenient field capture (`JsonElement` for uncertain polymorphics).
- Phase 4: Deterministic normalization with typed fallbacks (log & throw on impossible shapes).
- Phase 5: Mapping to internal canonical model (immutable record) used for embeddings + persistence.

Future Hardening Targets:
- Handle potential variability in: `author.num_games_owned` (could become string), `review` (null vs empty), localized fields.
- Add schema fingerprint hashing to quickly classify known variant patterns.
- Introduce progressive backoff / skip-after-N-failures for a single app ID to avoid blocking entire batch.

Success Criteria Achieved:
- Real embeddings for both games and reviews appear at scale (multi-minute ingestion with >500ms per embedding latency → authentic model activity).
- Zero-seed condition eliminated pre-crash (progress occurs before isolated malformed payload stops run).

Open Gap:
- Need non-fatal isolation of singular malformed appdetails while persisting previously ingested valid entities (currently hard fail halts run at first bad app ID).
