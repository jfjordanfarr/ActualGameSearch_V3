Created [](file:///workspaces/ActualGameSearch_V3/AI-Agent-Workspace/Background/ConversationHistory/Summarized/SUMMARIZED_05_2025-09-24.md)

Preamble: I'll produced the Day 5 (2025-09-24) summarized scaffold in the established interleaved, fact‑checked format to match the prior four days.

## Summary of What’s Done
- Added new file `SUMMARIZED_05_2025-09-24.md` with:
  - Quick Synopsis + Major Arcs aligned to Day 5 activity.
  - Key mandates and turning points with line anchors extracted from the raw Day 5 log.
  - Commit window (currently one commit `b92fc6e` captured).
  - Planned structure mirroring earlier days (turn-by-turn + issue chronicles + governance evolution + behavioral patterns + gaps).
  - Batch 1 (Turns 1–10) enumerated with summaries, rationale, verbatim excerpts (≤6 lines each), anchors, forward references.
  - Placeholders for Issue Chronicles (Cosmos query/emulator, Worker resilience, Embedding context window), Governance Artifact Evolution, Behavioral Patterns, Gaps & Next Actions, and Verification Appendix.
  - Initial Gaps & Next Actions list seeded.

## Next Natural Enhancements (if you want me to continue)
1. Enumerate Turns 11–End (through line ~3033) in additional batches (likely 11–20, 21–30, 31–40, plus tail).
2. Populate Issue Chronicles with anchored narrative:
   - Cosmos SQL syntax + emulator capability limits (lines around 1349–1421, 1526, 2503).
   - Worker resilience evolution (2104–2252 cluster).
   - Embedding context window / 2k vs 8k resolution (2272–2304, 2503–2646, 2668–2866).
3. Governance Artifact Evolution: Diff constitution/research/tasks vs prior day (once related commits appear).
4. Behavioral Patterns Reinforced: Expand placeholder with concrete heuristics (option selection, scope policing, empirical verification).
5. Verification Appendix: Add reproducible grep/wc + sample curl + expected error signatures.

Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with the next batch (Turns 11–20) now, or pivot to today’s development tasks—you mentioned we’ll discuss them after this summary, so I’m ready to continue either direction. Just say the word and I’ll advance.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: That's going well! I'll provide the full contents of the other 3 summarized forms so that you have a good sense of the style as you proceed through the rest of the conversation history file.

GitHub Copilot: I will read targeted line ranges from the raw Day 5 log to extract content for Turns 11–20 and then update the Day 5 summary file accordingly.

I will update the Day 5 summary file to add Turns 11–20 and an initial chronicle section based on extracted raw lines. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Added Batch 2 (Turns 11–20) plus initial expansions of the Issue Chronicles (Cosmos emulator capability, Worker resilience, Embedding context window) to `SUMMARIZED_05_2025-09-24.md`, preserving established style: line anchors, rationale, forward references, and actionable next steps.

## Delta Summary
- Inserted Turn 11–20 entries with precise line ranges and excerpts.
- Added expanded drafts for sections 3.1–3.3 (Issue Chronicles) including mitigation + next actions.
- No other sections altered; Batch 1 and placeholders retained for continuity.
- Commit correlation placeholders remain where hashes not yet observed (only `b92fc6e` currently in Day 5 window).

## Next Suggested Enhancements
1. Continue Turn enumeration (Turns 21+ through tail if needed for completeness).
2. Add Governance Artifact Evolution section: diff constitution/research/tasks vs pre-Day-5 state.
3. Populate Behavioral Patterns Reinforced with concrete heuristics (scope control, fallback probing, error surfacing).
4. Add Verification Appendix commands referencing new chronicles (e.g., grep for `Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k`, curl health probe once implemented).
5. (Optional) Introduce a lightweight commit once all Day 5 turns are captured to freeze provenance.

Let me know if you want me to proceed with Turns 21+ now or shift to today’s dev items. Just give the word and I’ll continue.

Let's proceed with Turns 21 and beyond for conversation 5. Perform suggested enhancements 1-4.

GitHub Copilot: To continue enumerating Turns 21+ and add the remaining sections, I’ll read the tail of the Day 5 raw log to capture the final exchanges, then update the Day 5 summary file with new turns and the requested sections.

Great—I'll finish out Day 5 and add the requested sections so we have a clean, complete summary ready for today’s dev work.

Plan
- Enumerate Turns 21–tail from the Day 5 raw file.
- Expand the Issue Chronicles if needed based on tail content.
- Add Governance Artifact Evolution, Behavioral Patterns Reinforced, and a Verification Appendix.
- Keep the same style as the earlier summaries with anchors, excerpts, and rationale.

What I did
- Turn enumeration: Added new section “Turn-by-Turn (Batch 3 — Turns 21–Tail)” covering the tail where the commit message proposal is prepared.
- Enhanced Issue Chronicles (3.1–3.3): Converted placeholders into expanded drafts with clear next actions tied to Day 5.
- Governance Artifact Evolution: Summarized the Day 5 governance and docs updates (constitution intent; research/tasks/spec mentions; infra docs).
- Behavioral Patterns Reinforced: Concrete heuristics grounded in Day 5 (scope control, capability-aware fallback, error surfacing, probe/cache/guard, repeatability, empirical validation).
- Verification Appendix: Added actionable commands for provenance checks, infra/model setup verification, API in-memory fallback, worker resilience, and endpoint sanity.

Where to find it
- File updated: SUMMARIZED_05_2025-09-24.md
- Key new sections:
  - “Turn-by-Turn (Batch 3 — Turns 21–Tail)”
  - “Governance Artifact Evolution (Day 5)”
  - “Behavioral Patterns Reinforced (Concrete Heuristics)”
  - “Verification Appendix (Day 5 additions)”
  - Issue Chronicles (3.1–3.3) expanded with concrete Next Actions

Quick verification commands (copy-paste)
- Day 5 raw file shape and anchors:
  ```bash
  wc -l AI-Agent-Workspace/Background/ConversationHistory/Raw/05_2025_09_24.md
  grep -nE '^(jfjordanfarr|GitHub Copilot): ' AI-Agent-Workspace/Background/ConversationHistory/Raw/05_2025_09_24.md | head -n 40
  git --no-pager log --since='2025-09-24 00:00:00' --until='2025-09-24 23:59:59' --date=iso --pretty=format:'%h %ad %s' -- .
  ```
- Infra/model setup and 8k embedding health:
  ```bash
  ls -l infrastructure/Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k infrastructure/setup-ollama-models.sh infrastructure/README.md
  ./infrastructure/setup-ollama-models.sh
  curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/tags | jq -r '.models[].name' | grep '^nomic-embed-8k'
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"model":"nomic-embed-8k:latest","prompt":"hello","options":{"num_ctx":8192}}' | jq '.embedding | length'
  ```
- API emulator fallback and in-memory smoke:
  ```bash
  grep -n "forceInMemory" -n src/ActualGameSearch.Api/Program.cs
  DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_TESTHOST=true ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:8080 \
    dotnet run --project src/ActualGameSearch.Api/ActualGameSearch.Api.csproj &
  sleep 2
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/search/games?q=puzzle&top=3 | jq .
  kill %1
  ```
- Worker resilience smoke:
  ```bash
  dotnet build src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/ActualGameSearch.Worker.csproj -c Debug
  DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_TESTHOST=true dotnet run --project src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/ActualGameSearch.Worker.csproj | sed -n '1,120p'
  ```
- Endpoint contract quick check:
  ```bash
  grep -n "MapGet(\\s*\\\"/api/search" src/ActualGameSearch.Api/Program.cs
  ```

Completion summary
- Requested enhancements 1–4 are done:
  - 1) Turns 21–tail: Done.
  - 2) Governance Artifact Evolution: Added, pending final commit correlation once hashes exist.
  - 3) Behavioral Patterns Reinforced: Added with concrete heuristics.
  - 4) Verification Appendix: Added with actionable commands.

If you’re good with this Day 5 summary, we can switch to today’s dev items next. If you want, I can also immediately enumerate any remaining fine-grained turns (e.g., subdividing 21–24 further) or wire the `/api/health/embedding` probe mentioned in the Next Actions.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Our next development item is to raise a PR into main. The next larger development goals will be branched off of main in a new 'spec-kit'-driven feature branch. 

GitHub Copilot: I’ll verify the git state, run build/tests, push the branch, and open a pull request into main with a clear title and body summarizing the changes.
