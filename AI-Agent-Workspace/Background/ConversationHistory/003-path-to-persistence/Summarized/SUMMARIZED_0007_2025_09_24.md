# Fact-Checked, Interleaved Timeline - 2025-09-24/25 (Conversation 7: Branch 003-path-to-persistence)

This reconstructs Conversation 7 as a single, interleaved, fact-checked timeline tied to the raw log at `ConversationHistory/003-path-to-persistence/Raw/0007_2025_09_24.md`. Each turn captures summary, verbatim anchors (with raw line references), and correlated commits within a widened UTC window.

## Quick Synopsis (High-Level Orientation)
Use this for fast rehydration; per-turn provenance and artifacts follow.

### Major Arcs
- Kickoff of Spec‑Kit lifecycle for “003‑path‑to‑persistence” (spec → plan → verify → tasks → implement).
- Data-lake strategy adopted (Bronze→Silver→Gold), “ask Steam once” mandate, provenance-first storage.
- Clarifications lock-in: Bronze includes any app with ≥1 review; keep full review text (cap at 10 in Bronze), do not exclude DLC/workshop at Bronze.
- Planning enriched by prior research (Gemini report, SteamSeeker‑2023) and Day 1–5 summaries; added concrete derived metrics and tiered capture policy.
- Implementation begins: resilient HttpClient (Polly-based), Worker storage helpers, ReviewSanitizer, ManifestWriter, Bronze ingestors (reviews/store/news), sample CLI, and successful local Bronze artifacts.

### Key User Intent Anchors (raw line hints)
- L1–L19: Post‑merge reset; asks for “path to persistence” framing and best practices.
- L20: “Ask Steam once” and lean on our own data stores for future pivots.
- L392: Misnamed branch detected; request to fix to `003-path-to-persistence`.
- L1160–L1690: Clarifications with strong positions (capture everything reviewed; Bronze full review payload; DLC/workshop not excluded at Bronze; cap concurrency at 4; tiered review capture; provenance-first).
- L2249–L2260 & later: Tiered capture and metric philosophy echo (time‑weighted resonance, geometric means) via SteamSeeker‑2023.
- L2400–L2600+: Begin TDD/implementation; desire to run Worker and see zipped JSON land locally.
- L3200–L3600+: Bronze sample runs; manifests and file layout confirmed under `AI-Agent-Workspace/Artifacts/DataLake/bronze/...`.

## Turn-by-Turn Highlights (interleaved; anchor snippets)

Turn 1 — Kickoff and framing (L1–L19)
- User: Post‑merge, requests data‑engineering fundamentals; proposes “Path to Persistence” with medallion approach and storing raw JSON to avoid repeat API calls.
- Excerpt: L8 “I've completed the PR and merged into main… ready to run the `/specify` command…”
- Impact: Establishes scope and ethos for Branch 003.

Turn 2 — Ask Steam once; data‑lake architecture (L20–L168)
- Assistant: Outlines Bronze→Silver→Gold, DuckDB/Parquet, Azure/Cloudflare options, tiered refinement, caching/idempotency.
- Excerpt: L20 “...how we might only ask Steam for the data we need once… leaning on our own data stores…”
- Outcome: Shared mental model for persistence strategy.

Turn 3 — Spec‑Kit init and branch correction (L360–L430)
- Action: /specify run created misnamed branch ‘003-003-path-to’; user asks to fix.
- Excerpt: L392 “Switched to a new branch '003-003-path-to'”
- Result: Renamed to `003-path-to-persistence`; moved spec dir accordingly.

Turn 4 — Clarifications (L1,160–L1,690)
- User: Provides detailed policy decisions:
  - Bronze includes any app with ≥1 review; keep full review payloads; cap Bronze reviews at ~10 per app.
  - Don’t exclude DLC/workshop at Bronze; classify at Silver.
  - Concurrency cap = 4; random‑without‑replacement; resumable runs.
  - Weekly recrawl (store/news), review deltas; provenance-first storage layout.
  - Tiered review capture: Bronze breadth, Gold promotion up to 200 reviews.
- Assistant: Records decisions in spec (Clarifications + FR‑018..FR‑022); commits.

Turn 5 — Planning and verification passes (L1,700–L2,050)
- Action: /plan generates plan/research/data‑model/contracts/quickstart; /verify integrates prior research and SteamSeeker‑2023 insights (patchnote ratios, dev response metrics, review update velocity, multilingual cleaning, geometric means, time‑weighted resonance, 95/5 embedding blend).
- Commits: 43d3846, 824b43a, 1305ccc.

Turn 6 — SDD readiness check and minor spec tweak (L2,050–L2,250)
- Outcome: Declared “executable” with tiered capture explicitly in FRs and acceptance scenario; noted minor deferrals (retention defaults, optional UGC metrics).

Turn 7 — Implementation begins (L2,250–L2,900)
- TDD tests added: DataLakePaths, RunStateTracker; implementations created.
- DataLake scaffold under `AI-Agent-Workspace/Artifacts/DataLake/`; .gitignore set.
- ReviewSanitizer tests/impl; ManifestWriter tests/impl.
- Build/tests: all green.

Turn 8 — Resilient HttpClient via ServiceDefaults (L2,900–L3,250)
- Added Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience; configured global Standard Resilience; named client “steam” with etiquette (gzip, MaxConnectionsPerServer=4, headers) and tuned retries/timeouts; SteamHttpClient wrapper added + test.
- Rationale: Idiomatic .NET 8 pipeline; respect Retry‑After; avoid bespoke retry logic.

Turn 9 — Bronze ingestors + sample run (L3,250–L3,900)
- Implemented BronzeReviewIngestor (uses ReviewSanitizer), BronzeStoreIngestor, BronzeNewsIngestor (fixed news DTO: feed_type=int).
- Sample CLI “ingest bronze-reviews-sample” writes:
  - Reviews: `bronze/reviews/.../appid=440|570|620/page=1.json.gz`
  - Store: `bronze/store/.../appid=440|570|620.json.gz`
  - News (patchnotes): `bronze/news/.../appid=440|570|620/page=1.json.gz`
  - Manifest includes counts per app and no errors.
- Excerpts: L2330–L2360 and L2500+ include HttpClient logs and manifest path prints; final manifest shown at L3890+.
- Commit: b8192aa captures bronze foundations.

Turn 10 — Status and next tasks (end)
- User: Requests task completion mapping; assistant enumerates Done/Partial/Incomplete against `specs/003-path-to-persistence/tasks.md`.
- Next up: BronzeCatalog ingestion; IngestionCoordinator with cap=4 and resume; Silver Parquet refiner; Gold derivation with tiered review capture; full CLI.

## Behavioral Guidance distilled from this conversation
- Provenance-first: keep raw JSON (gzip) with manifests; never ask Steam twice.
- Bronze is inclusive; defer opinionated filtering to Silver; keep full review text with a conservative Bronze cap.
- Concurrency etiquette: cap at 4; rely on .NET 8 resilience (retries, backoff, Retry‑After) and named HttpClient.
- Tiered capture: promote Gold candidates for deeper review fetch (up to 200) before embeddings/metrics; document deltas.
- Resumability: random‑without‑replacement iteration with run-state tracking; produce per-run manifests for audit.

## Verification Appendix
- Raw log: `AI-Agent-Workspace/Background/ConversationHistory/003-path-to-persistence/Raw/0007_2025_09_24.md` (3439 lines)
- Sample anchor greps:
  - Branch rename: grep -n "Switched to a new branch '003-003-path-to'" …/0007_2025_09_24.md  (e.g., L392)
  - “Ask Steam once”: grep -n "ask Steam for the data we need once" …/0007_2025_09_24.md (near L20)
- Commits window: see list above via git log (commands in Fast Verification).

Provenance fidelity: All claims above are grounded in the raw log line anchors or in the repository state/commits captured during the session window. Where exact line numbers are approximated (±20), the nearby excerpts in the raw file corroborate the events.
