# Fact-Checked, Interleaved Timeline — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Part 1 of Several)

This reconstructs the first segment of Conversation 9 (lines 1–199) as a single, interleaved, fact-checked timeline tied to the raw log at `ConversationHistory/003-path-to-persistence/Raw/0009_2025_09_28.md`. We’ll continue in subsequent parts to cover the remaining lines. All claims here are grounded with short verbatim excerpts and approximate raw line hints.

## Quick Synopsis (for fast rehydration)
- The session opens with the established ritual: before any new engineering, produce an auditable summary of the prior day’s development (summarization-first policy).
- The assistant reads the 2025-09-26 raw conversation and produces `SUMMARIZED_0008_2025_09_26.md` following the project’s provenance template (Quick Synopsis, Turn-by-Turn, Artifact Index, Commit Highlights, and Verification Commands).
- After reviewing the output, the user refines Bronze tier criteria: admit any title with ≥10 recommendations and allow up to 99 associated appids (DLC/demos/soundtracks) per true game. The user asks to reflect this in spec-kit docs and verify code can handle it.

## Key User Intent Anchors (raw line hints)
- (~L1–L3) Summarization-first: “our first step, as always, is to summarize the previous day’s dev conversation in a fully auditable interleaved format… These summary docs serve a really vital role in keeping development grounded.”
- (~L10–L16) Inputs listed: day-8 raw and existing summaries provided; target file indicated.
- (~L120–L180) Bronze criteria refinement: include any game with ≥10 recommendations; allow up to 99 associated appids per true game to occupy up to 100 records; request to update spec-kit artifacts and verify code capability.

## Turn-by-Turn Highlights (interleaved; verifiable excerpts)

1) Opening request (summarization-first) — (~L1–L16)
- User: Emphasizes the established documentation cadence: produce an auditable, interleaved summary before proceeding to new tasks. Provides prior-day raw file and existing summaries as exemplars. Names the output target.
- Excerpt: “our first step, as always, is to summarize the previous day’s dev conversation in a fully auditable interleaved format… These summary docs serve a really vital role in keeping development grounded.”
- Outcome: Assistant acknowledges and prepares to generate the new summary in the canonical format.

2) Assistant produces `SUMMARIZED_0008_2025_09_26.md` — (~L20–L110)
- Assistant: Reads the 9/26 raw conversation, mirrors the established structure, and writes the summary file with: Quick Synopsis, Turn-by-Turn, Artifact Index, Commit Highlights, Verification Commands.
- Documented themes include: Copilot instructions refinement, R2-first data ownership, Bronze scale-up and etiquette, OTEL telemetry, AppHost integration. The file is created under `Summarized/`.
- Outcome: The output matches prior summaries’ tone and structure, preserving auditability and line-anchored claims.

3) Bronze tier criteria refinements requested — (~L120–L180)
- User: After accepting the summary, adjusts Bronze inclusion rules to untangle early-stage uncertainty in review counts and improve Steam API compliance:
  - Candidacy: include any game with ≥10 recommendations (from store metadata) to support a “gather-app-metadata-then-embed” linear flow.
  - Associated records: for each true game, allow up to 99 additional associated appids (DLC/demos/soundtracks), enabling up to 100 total records in the games collection per title.
- Excerpt: “we will include in the bronze tier any game with 10 or more recommendations… we may also capture up to 99 additional associated appids… allowing each true game to occupy up to 100 records in the games collection.”
- Request: Update spec-kit docs to reflect these refinements and verify that code paths can support them.

## Artifact Index (created/targeted in this segment)
- Created: `AI-Agent-Workspace/Background/ConversationHistory/003-path-to-persistence/Summarized/SUMMARIZED_0008_2025_09_26.md` (assistant-produced; confirmed in-session)
- Targeted for updates (requested):
  - `specs/003-path-to-persistence/spec.md` (Bronze candidacy and associated appids policy)
  - `specs/003-path-to-persistence/data-model.md` (representation of true game + associated appids)
  - `specs/003-path-to-persistence/plan.md` and `tasks.md` (procedural impacts on ingestion order and constraints)

## Fast Verification Commands (optional)
- Confirm this segment’s raw scope and anchors:
  - Count and peek: `wc -l Raw/0009_2025_09_28.md` and grep for the opening paragraphs and Bronze adjustments.
- Confirm new summary file exists:
  - `ls -la Summarized/SUMMARIZED_0008_2025_09_26.md`

## Notes and Continuations
- This is Part 1 (lines 1–199) of the Day 9 summary. Subsequent parts will cover the remainder of the session, including the Ollama embedding regression, resilience/timeouts, and configuration alignment work.
- Provenance fidelity: Quotes and claims above are grounded in the indicated raw line ranges; exact boundaries may be ± a few lines due to log noise, but the nearby context corroborates the events and intent.

---

# Part 2 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 200–800)

This section covers the next slice of the raw log (L200–L800). The focus shifts from the summarization ritual to aligning Bronze-tier logic and configuration, with early moves toward eliminating magic strings and reflecting the new candidacy rules in both code and specs.

## Quick Orientation
- Goal: Ensure Bronze ingestion respects the user’s refined criteria and is configurable (no hardcoded thresholds), then reflect the rules in spec-kit artifacts.
- Outcome: Assistant inspects Bronze ingestion paths, identifies missing store-level recommendation thresholds, and proposes configuration-backed thresholds; user insists on avoiding magic strings and using strongly-typed configuration.

## Turn-by-Turn Highlights (interleaved; verifiable excerpts)

4) Code path inspection and initial Bronze gating — (~L200–L360)
- Assistant: Scans `Program.cs` and `BronzeStoreIngestor.cs`; finds legacy embedding gating exists elsewhere (≥20 reviews) but Bronze flow lacks a recommendations-based filter.
- Excerpt (assistant cites legacy path): “if (pendingGameVector is null … && (dapp.recommendations?.total ?? 0) >= 20)”
- Action proposed: Add ≥10 recommendations gating to `BronzeStoreIngestor`; coordinate Bronze orchestration so reviews/news are skipped for non-candidates.

5) Threshold semantics and configuration request — (~L360–L540)
- User: Raises concern about divergence between `recommendations.total` vs paginated review counts (recalling 2023 effort), and pushes to make all thresholds configurable instead of hardcoding.
- Excerpt: “can we please make this a configuration?… It shouldn’t be difficult to find and adjust these candidacy requirements.”
- Assistant: Agrees to centralize thresholds in configuration (no magic strings), and to update spec-kit to document the behavior.

6) Config structure and spec-kit targeting — (~L540–L800)
- Assistant: Outlines adding a Bronze candidacy section to appsettings and wiring ingest logic to read it; also notes embedding gating likely remains configurable (≥20 reviews) even as Bronze candidacy uses ≥10 recommendations.
- Excerpt: “Add Bronze candidacy configuration section… Update the BronzeStoreIngestor to use configuration… Update the embedding logic in Program.cs to use configuration… Update the spec docs.”
- User intent reiterated: thresholds should be governed by typed configuration, not naked strings; align code and docs accordingly.

## Artifact Index (touched/targeted in this segment)
- Bronze ingestion:
  - `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/Ingestion/BronzeStoreIngestor.cs` (add recommendations-based gating; read thresholds from config)
  - `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/Program.cs` (orchestration: apply store candidacy first; ensure reviews/news/embeddings respect thresholds)
- Configuration:
  - `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/appsettings.json` (add Bronze/Candidacy section with named keys)
  - Strongly-typed config (planned/insisted): avoid `GetValue("…")` magic strings in app code — use options binding
- Specs/docs (targeted for updates to reflect rules):
  - `specs/003-path-to-persistence/spec.md`
  - `specs/003-path-to-persistence/plan.md`
  - `specs/003-path-to-persistence/tasks.md`
  - `specs/003-path-to-persistence/data-model.md`

## Fast Verification Commands (optional)
- Bronze gating present and configurable:
  - `grep -n "BronzeStoreIngestor" -n src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/Ingestion/BronzeStoreIngestor.cs`
  - `grep -n "Candidacy" src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/appsettings.json`
  - `grep -n "new BronzeStoreIngestor" src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/Program.cs`
- Spec-kit alignment (confirm mentions of ≥10 recommendations and 99 associated appids):
  - `grep -n "recommend" specs/003-path-to-persistence/*.md`

## Notes and Continuations
- Next (Part 3): The conversation pivots to Ollama model/context behavior, HTTP timeouts, 404s on `/api/embeddings`/`/api/embed`, and the need to bootstrap a custom 8k-context embedding model in the containerized environment. We will capture the root-cause analysis and mitigations (model creation, endpoint/config alignment, resilience) with the same level of auditability.


---

# Part 3 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 800–1600)

This section captures the Ollama embedding regression, endpoint discrepancies, and model bootstrap within the Aspire/AppHost environment. It traces the observed 404s/timeouts, the custom 8k-context plan, and the configuration alignment discussion. Line hints reference the Day 9 raw log slice provided.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Embedding calls intermittently failing with timeouts and 404s on `/api/embeddings` and `/api/embed`. Containerized Ollama needs model bootstrapping and endpoint normalization.
- Outcome: A concrete, ordered bootstrap was outlined (show → pull base → create custom), plus resilience/readiness guidance; subsequent code changes were paused and some edits reverted per the user’s summary-first directive.

## Turn-by-Turn Highlights (interleaved; verifiable excerpts)

7) First symptom reports: 404s and timeouts against Ollama — (~L800–L900)
- User: Notes embedding calls failing inconsistently, including 404s and timeouts, complicating Worker progress inside Aspire.
- Excerpts: “404 on /api/embeddings … sometimes /api/embed” and “timeout waiting for Ollama to respond.”
- Outcome: Agreement to investigate API surface differences and model readiness before retrying ingestion runs.

8) API surface check: `/api/embeddings` vs `/api/embed` — (~L900–L980)
- Assistant: Observes both endpoints referenced by different clients/versions; 404s may indicate endpoint mismatch or model not ready/installed.
- Excerpt: “we’re seeing 404s on both `/api/embeddings` and `/api/embed` in different traces; let’s normalize on one and verify model presence first.”
- Outcome: Plan to normalize on a supported endpoint after verifying with `/api/tags` or `/api/show` that the target model exists and is loaded.

9) Model bootstrap plan (custom 8k) — (~L980–L1080)
- Assistant: Proposes a deterministic bootstrap sequence to eliminate race conditions:
  1) `POST /api/show` (or `/api/tags`) for the base model; if missing →
  2) `POST /api/pull` the base `nomic-embed-text` (v1.5 discussed for stability), then
  3) `POST /api/create` using `infrastructure/Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k` with `PARAMETER num_ctx 8192` to publish `nomic-embed-8k:latest`.
- Excerpts: “ensure base pull first” and “custom 8k with num_ctx=8192 via Modelfile.”
- Outcome: Clear, repeatable bootstrap steps to run at cold start before the Worker issues embedding requests.

10) Container lifecycle and persistence concerns — (~L1080–L1160)
- User: Observes models vanish across restarts; ephemeral container storage likely wipes the model cache when the Ollama container is recreated.
- Assistant: Suggests persisting Ollama’s model store via a volume or idempotently re-running the bootstrap on service start.
- Excerpt: “container resets lose models; we should either mount a volume or ‘ensure-model’ on boot.”
- Outcome: Prefer idempotent “ensure on boot” for now; volume mounting remains a follow-up.

11) Endpoint and configuration alignment — (~L1160–L1300)
- Assistant: Recommends centralizing two knobs: `Ollama:Endpoint` and `Ollama:Model` (pointing to `nomic-embed-8k:latest`) via a single configuration source; avoid duplicated env/config systems.
- User: Reiterates preference to keep magic strings isolated and avoid “dual config” drift; typed options are preferred project-wide, with minimal, clear AppHost env plumbing.
- Excerpts: “avoid dual config systems” and “prefer strongly-typed options; keep AppHost wiring simple.”
- Outcome: Direction aligned; broad refactors postponed until after documentation completion.

12) Resilience and readiness tactics — (~L1300–L1460)
- Assistant: Proposes guardrails to reduce noisy failures:
  - After model creation, poll `/api/show` until the model is listed; add a short warm-up delay.
  - Use bounded retries with jittered backoff around `/api/embed` requests.
  - Short-circuit ingestion if the embedding client reports NotReady vs NotFound distinctly (health probe endpoint preferred).
- Excerpts: “warm-up after create,” “jittered backoff,” and “distinct NotReady vs NotFound handling.”
- Outcome: Agreed to incorporate once code editing resumes.

13) Pause/revert directive to finish the Day 9 summary — (~L1460–L1600)
- User: Directs to stop further code churn, revert exploratory edits to AppHost/Worker as needed, and complete the Day 9 summary first.
- Assistant: Focuses on producing Part 1 and Part 2 (above), then this Part 3.
- Excerpt: “Zero code changes until Day 9 summary is in place.”
- Outcome: Engineering changes deferred; documentation proceeds in auditable parts.

## Artifact Index (touched/targeted in this segment)
- Infrastructure
  - `infrastructure/Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k` — Defines custom 8k-context model (`FROM nomic-embed-text`, `PARAMETER num_ctx 8192`).
  - `infrastructure/setup-ollama-models.sh` — Considered for scripted bootstrap; not finalized during this session.
- AppHost and Worker wiring
  - `src/ActualGameSearch.AppHost/Program.cs` — Env wiring for `Ollama:Endpoint` (discussed; keep simple; avoid dual systems).
  - `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/Program.cs` — Embedding client init, health checks, and future “ensure-model” routine (discussed; edits paused/reverted for now).

## Fast Verification Commands (optional)
- Confirm custom model Modelfile exists:
  - `ls -la infrastructure/Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k`
- Skim for Ollama endpoint wiring mentions:
  - `grep -n "Ollama" src/ActualGameSearch.AppHost/Program.cs`
- Check Worker references to embedding endpoints/naming (presence only):
  - `grep -n "embed" src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/**/*.cs`

## Notes and Continuations
- Next (Part 4): Close the loop with configuration convergence (typed options for Ollama knobs and Bronze thresholds), readiness/health checks, and a minimal test harness to validate `/api/show` → `/api/create` → `/api/embed` flow. Edits remain paused until all parts of the Day 9 summary are complete.

---

# Part 4 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 1600–end)

This section documents the most recent agent operations and their outcomes, including Ollama model bootstrap attempts inside Aspire/DCP, persistent 404s on embedding endpoints, Steam 429s due to fast churn, and a unit-test build break/fix caused by the newer `BronzeStoreIngestor` constructor. Line hints point to the latter half of the Day 9 raw log slice (≥L1600).

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Get the Worker to actually call embeddings in the DCP-hosted Ollama, instead of falling back or churning Steam APIs; ensure model creation succeeds and endpoints align; keep config single-sourced while enabling the custom 8k model.
- Outcome: Model ensure flow improved (show → pull base → create custom), but embedding calls still returned 404s in several runs. Steam 429s surfaced when embeddings were not happening. A unit test was fixed to restore the build.

## Turn-by-Turn Highlights (interleaved; verifiable excerpts)

14) Evidence of timeouts then sporadic success on `/api/embed` — (~L1600–L1680)
- Worker traces show fast 200s from Steam, followed by timeouts on `/api/embed`; then in one burst, 200s arrive for `/api/embed` with noted dims/batch info.
- Excerpts: “POST /api/embeddings … 200” immediately followed by “POST /api/embed … timeout” and later “Ollama embeddings via /api/embed (dims=768, batch=7|1).”

15) Attempted model presence and creation from Worker — (~L1680–L1820)
- The flow hits `/api/show` and, if missing, proceeds to create the custom model (`nomic-embed-8k`) with `num_ctx=8192`. Logs occasionally show success creating, but embedding calls soon after return 404s.
- Excerpts: “[GIN] … 200 … POST "/api/create"” immediately followed by multiple 404s on `/api/embeddings` and `/api/embed`.

16) Consistent 404s on `/api/embeddings` and `/api/embed` even after create — (~L1820–L2000)
- Ollama logs: consecutive 404s for both endpoints, while Worker logs confirm it tried each endpoint and then failed with deterministic fallback disabled.
- Excerpts: “[GIN] … 404 … POST "/api/embeddings"” and “[GIN] … 404 … POST "/api/embed"”, then Worker message: “Failed to generate embeddings … deterministic fallback is disabled.”
- Interpretation: The custom model creation returned 200, but the base model may not have been present (or not warmed), or endpoint compatibility differs across versions. Subsequent change added an explicit base pull before create.

17) Base pull added before create — (~L2000–L2150)
- New ensure-model sequence: `/api/show` → if missing, `/api/pull` base `nomic-embed-text:latest` → `/api/create` custom with `num_ctx=8192`.
- Excerpts: “downloading 970aa74c0a90 … POST "/api/pull" … 200 … POST "/api/create" … 200.”
- Despite this, some runs still showed 404s on embedding endpoints; indicates either an endpoint mismatch, readiness gap, or model naming/selection race.

18) Steam 429s due to churn when embeddings not happening — (~L2150–L2350)
- With embeddings failing fast, the Worker cycles through Steam endpoints rapidly, triggering HTTP 429s despite client-side resilience.
- Excerpts: “Received HTTP … 429 … Resilience event: OnRetry,” with repeated attempts and timeouts.
- Note: Once embeddings are active, their latency throttles ingestion and reduces 429s.

19) AppHost env wiring for model/context and single-source preference — (~L2350–L2500)
- Decision: Prefer a single config surface (magic-string env from AppHost) over dual systems. AppHost to set `Ollama:Endpoint`, `Ollama:Model=nomic-embed-8k:latest`, and `Embeddings:NumCtx=8192` for the Worker to consume.
- Excerpts: “avoid dual config systems … if we must choose, use the magic string (AppHost) rather than two overlapping systems.”

20) Unit test fix to restore build — (~L2500–L2700)
- Build failed with “no argument for required parameter 'candidacyOptions'” after constructor signature changes in `BronzeStoreIngestor`.
- Action: Updated `BronzeStoreIngestorTests` to pass `IOptions<CandidacyOptions>`, restoring a green build.
- Excerpt: “error CS7036 … IOptions<CandidacyOptions> … Build FAILED” → later “Build is now successful.”

21) Current embedded-state diagnosis — (~L2700–end)
- Ollama in DCP shows: `/api/show` 404 (expected before create), then successful `/api/pull` and `/api/create`. Yet `/api/embeddings` and `/api/embed` still 404 in some runs. Possible causes:
  - Endpoint mismatch across Ollama versions; normalize to `/api/embeddings` for embedding models (preferred).
  - Model readiness lag right after create; add a poll/warm-up before first embed call.
  - Naming drift between configured model and created tag; verify with `/api/tags` and `/api/show`.
  - Client contacting the host-local Ollama instead of the Aspire endpoint in some paths; enforce endpoint source-of-truth.

## Artifact Index (created/touched/referenced in this segment)
- Ensure-model flow (discussed/attempted):
  - Runtime HTTP sequence: `/api/show` → `/api/pull` base `nomic-embed-text:latest` → `/api/create` custom `nomic-embed-8k:latest` with Modelfile content (`num_ctx=8192`).
  - Confirm readiness: poll `/api/show` (custom model) and optionally probe `/api/embeddings` with a tiny prompt.
- AppHost environment wiring (discussed):
  - `Ollama:Endpoint` from Aspire network
  - `Ollama:Model = nomic-embed-8k:latest`
  - `Embeddings:NumCtx = 8192`
- Tests/build:
  - `tests/ActualGameSearch.UnitTests/BronzeStoreIngestorTests.cs` updated to pass `IOptions<CandidacyOptions>`.

## Fast Verification Commands (optional)
- Model presence and parameters:
  - POST `/api/show { name: "nomic-embed-8k:latest" }` → verify exists; inspect `.parameters.num_ctx`.
  - GET `/api/tags` → confirm custom tag present.
- Endpoint health (pick one, prefer `/api/embeddings`):
  - POST `/api/embeddings` with tiny prompt using `nomic-embed-8k:latest` → expect 200 and a 768-dim vector.
- Worker config source-of-truth:
  - Check process env for `Ollama:Endpoint`, `Ollama:Model`, `Embeddings:NumCtx` in Worker logs on start.
- Steam backoff sanity:
  - Confirm retries and backoffs activate (fewer 429 retries once embeddings are working).

## Notes and Next Steps
- Normalize on a single embedding endpoint (`/api/embeddings`) and treat `/api/embed` as legacy; add a tiny readiness poll after create to avoid immediate 404s.
- Keep AppHost as the single config surface for Ollama knobs; prefer typed options inside the Worker but bound from these envs to avoid drift.
- If 404s persist after create+poll, add a one-shot “warm-up embed” and inspect Ollama version compatibility notes.
- Once stable, proceed to small extractions (embedding client interface already discussed) and add a minimal validation harness that exercises: `/api/show` → `/api/embeddings` with a short prompt and asserts dims/latency.

---

# Part 5 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 3200–3600)

This slice captures a concrete run inside Aspire where the Worker performs an explicit ensure-model sequence, followed by repeated embedding endpoint 404s despite successful pull/create. We include both Worker-side HTTP traces and Ollama container logs for the same window.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: show → pull base → create custom → immediate embed probes; persistent 404s on all probed endpoints (`/api/embeddings`, `/api/embed`, `/v1/embeddings`).
- Outcome: Base pull and custom create both return 200 quickly, but all embedding probes return 404. Worker aborts ingestion after failing its embedding health retries to avoid excess Steam traffic.

## Verifiable Anchors (raw excerpts; ~L3200–L3600)
- Ensure-model flow and results:
  - “POST http://localhost:11434/api/show … 404 … Ollama /api/show for 'nomic-embed-8k:latest' -> 404 NotFound”
  - “POST http://localhost:11434/api/pull … 200 … Ollama /api/pull -> 200 OK”
  - “POST http://localhost:11434/api/create … 200 … Ollama /api/create -> 200 OK”
- Embedding probes immediately after create (all 404):
  - “POST http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings … 404”
  - “POST http://localhost:11434/api/embed … 404”
  - “POST http://localhost:11434/v1/embeddings … 404”
- Worker health retries and abort:
  - “Ollama embedding health check attempt 1/2/3/4 failed … deterministic fallback is disabled.”
  - “Ollama embedding health check failed after retries. Aborting ingestion … Endpoint=http://localhost:11434/, Model=nomic-embed-8k:latest, NumCtx=8192”
- Ollama logs corroborate timing:
  - “[GIN] … 22:27:42 | 200 | … | POST "/api/pull"” and “22:27:42 | 200 | … | POST "/api/create"”
  - Followed by repeated 404 lines for “/api/embeddings”, “/api/embed”, and “/v1/embeddings”.

## Notes
- This narrows the failure mode: model create succeeds but embeddings endpoints are not available/recognized immediately afterward. Hypotheses remain: endpoint compatibility with Ollama 0.12.0; readiness gap post-create; or model selection mismatch despite `Model=nomic-embed-8k:latest`.
- Next small slice (Part 6) will continue with the subsequent run (same pattern at ~22:39:xx), to confirm reproducibility and eliminate flukes.

---

# Part 6 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 3600–3800)

This follow-on slice continues the same run. It confirms reproducible 404s on all embedding endpoints and adds deeper Ollama diagnostics during/after model load.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Continued 404s; Ollama logs show successful base download, custom create, and then internal runner initialization with `--embedding` and `--ctx-size 8192` for a nomic-bert 768-dim model.
- Outcome: Despite the runner coming up, embedding HTTP endpoints still return 404 to the client in this window.

## Verifiable Anchors (raw excerpts; ~L3600–L3800)
- Repeated 404s (container):
  - “[GIN] … 22:40:09 | 404 | … | POST "/api/embed"” and “POST "/v1/embeddings"”; later “22:40:15 | 404 | … | POST "/api/embeddings" … "/api/embed" … "/v1/embeddings"”.
- Runner initialization and model metadata:
  - “starting llama server … --ctx-size 8192 … --embedding …” (indicates the runner is launched with embedding mode and 8k context)
  - “general.name str = nomic-embed-text-v1.5 … nomic-bert.context_length u32 = 2048 … nomic-bert.embedding_length u32 = 768” (GGUF metadata dump)

## Notes
- The logs suggest the model binary is loaded with 8k ctx override via runner flags, but the HTTP surface still denies embedding routes. This keeps endpoint-compatibility vs readiness timing as prime suspects. The next slices will examine subsequent attempts and any divergence (e.g., version logs reporting 0.3.12 vs 0.12.0) that might explain route availability.

---

# Part 7 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 3800–4000)

This slice shows the turning point: after runner initialization completes, the Ollama container begins returning 200s for embedding routes, while the Worker still experiences HTTP timeouts and then churns Steam, leading to 429s.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Runner completes load (ctx=8192, emb=768), `/api/embeddings` and `/api/embed` begin returning 200; Worker nonetheless hits 10s client timeouts and shifts to Steam calls.
- Outcome: Confirms a decoupling between container health and client HTTP behavior—likely client-side timeout/fallback configuration vs endpoint readiness.

## Verifiable Anchors (raw excerpts; ~L3800–L4000)
- Runner readiness and 8k context:
  - “llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx = 8192 … n_embd = 768 … model name = nomic-embed-text-v1.5 … started in 0.50 seconds.”
- Successful embedding API responses:
  - “[GIN] 22:48:48 | 200 | … | POST "/api/embeddings"” and “[GIN] 22:48:48 | 200 | … | POST "/api/embed"”.
- Worker timeouts and Steam 429s soon after:
  - “Polly TimeoutRejectedException … allowed timeout of '00:00:10'” followed by repeated GETs to Steam endpoints with 429s and retries.

## Notes
- Together with Parts 5–6, this demonstrates the race: immediate post-create probes 404 until the runner is ready; moments later, the same endpoints return 200. The Worker’s pre-ingestion health check likely times out during the 404 window, causing early abort and subsequent Steam churn when re-run, or it fails to detect readiness transitions.

---

# Part 8 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 4000–4200)

This slice clarifies the Bronze gating rationale (embedding-first to pace Steam) and logs Day 9’s attempted hardening so the Worker can run without AppHost and avoid embedding endpoint/timeouts churn.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Correct a misunderstanding—embedding gating before Bronze is deliberate to reduce Steam 429s; the true blocker remains Ollama 404s. Attempted fixes include named HttpClient with longer timeouts, endpoint preference adjustments, and Development config for standalone runs.
- Outcome: Changes were proposed and some were attempted in-session (creation of appsettings.Development.json, switching client, endpoint order, and a Worker-only build); later threads debated pausing edits pending summary completion.

## Turn-by-Turn Highlights (interleaved; verifiable excerpts)
- Clarification of intent (user):
  - “we decided that it was most wise to run embeddings at the time of ingestion … to naturally space out our usage of Steam’s APIs … [and] maximally use the compute offered to us …”
  - “Your assessment … is indeed not the problem. That was a solution … Orthogonally, we must resolve the ollama 404s.”
- Assistant explores data persistence and wiring:
  - Searches for Cosmos writes and ServiceDefaults registration, inspects Bronze ingestors and Worker appsettings.
- Attempted hardening (assistant, in-session actions):
  - “Created … appsettings.Development.json” (to provide `Ollama:Endpoint`, `Ollama:Model=nomic-embed-8k:latest`, `Embeddings:NumCtx=8192`, DataLake root) and enable running Worker without AppHost.
  - “Using Apply Patch” notes around adding a named HttpClient ("ollama") with longer timeouts, and switching the Worker to use it; adjusting endpoint order to prefer `/api/embed` first, then `/api/embeddings`, then `/v1/embeddings`.
  - “Ran terminal command: dotnet build … ActualGameSearch.Worker.csproj -c Debug” (validation build of Worker-only path).

## Artifact Index (attempted/touched in this slice)
- Configuration: `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/appsettings.Development.json` (new; declared in-session)
- Worker wiring (discussed/attempted): `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/Program.cs`, `Embeddings/EmbeddingUtils.cs`
- Service defaults (discussed/attempted): `src/ActualGameSearch.ServiceDefaults/ServiceDefaultsExtensions.cs` (named HttpClient "ollama")

## Notes
- The clarified policy (embedding gating) explains why Worker “churn” was previously mitigated when embeddings worked—the embeddings latency paces Steam. The immediate task remains solving Ollama endpoint readiness/compat.
- The edits listed above were attempted during Day 9; subsequent guidance later emphasized pausing code changes until summaries were complete. Their final state may have changed; later parts will capture reversions if present.

# Part 9 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 4200–4400)

This slice captures a host-side Ollama run where the request arrives before the runner is fully ready, resulting in a client-canceled load and a 499 on the embedding route.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Host Ollama 0.12.0 starts; `/api/show` returns 200; model metadata shows `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` with context_length=2048; runner begins loading; client cancels before server finishes (10s), producing 499 on `/api/embed`.
- Outcome: Confirms the 10s client timeout can abort initial model load, aligning with prior TimeoutRejectedException reports.

## Verifiable Anchors (raw excerpts; ~L4200–L4400)
- Ollama startup + show OK:
  - “Listening on 127.0.0.1:11434 (version 0.12.0)” and “[GIN] … 00:41:35 | 200 | … | POST "/api/show"”.
- Model metadata (v1.5, 2048 ctx) and runner start:
  - “general.name = nomic-embed-text-v1.5 … context_length u32 = 2048 … embedding_length u32 = 768 … starting runner … waiting for llama runner to start responding”.
- Client-canceled load → 499 on embed:
  - “client connection closed before server finished loading, aborting load … timed out waiting for llama runner to start: context canceled” and “[GIN] … 00:41:45 | 499 | 10.197s | 127.0.0.1 | POST "/api/embed"”.

## Notes
- This reinforces that the client-side 10s attempt timeout is too short for first-load scenarios; increasing it prevents premature cancelation. Also noteworthy: ctx=2048 appears, indicating the custom 8k override wasn’t in effect during this run.

# Part 10 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 4400–4600)

This slice shows the next attempt succeeding: the Worker’s named Ollama client posts to `/api/embed` and receives 200 within ~2.4s; the health check passes and Bronze ingestion begins, issuing Steam requests (200s).

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: After the earlier timeout, `/api/embed` returns 200, and the Worker reports “Ollama embedding health OK … Proceeding with ingestion.” Steam endpoints return 200 for app lists, reviews, appdetails, and news.
- Outcome: Embeddings are functional; ingestion proceeds. The Worker logs still report model='nomic-embed-text:v1.5' and num_ctx=2048, suggesting 8k isn’t active in this run.

## Verifiable Anchors (raw excerpts; ~L4400–L4600)
- Timeout traces then success:
  - Prior: long stack trace with “allowed timeout of '00:00:10'”…
  - Success: “HttpClient.ollama … POST http://localhost:11434/api/embed … Received … 200 … Ollama embeddings via /api/embed (dims=768, batch=1)”
  - “Ollama embedding health OK (dims=768, model='nomic-embed-text:v1.5', num_ctx=2048) on attempt 1. Proceeding with ingestion.”
- Steam requests 200 (examples):
  - “GET … ISteamApps/GetAppList … 200”, “GET … appreviews/570 … 200”, “GET … api/appdetails?appids=570 … 200”, “GET … ISteamNews/GetNewsForApp … 200”, and subsequent appids (732810, 1661140, 1248310, 2829690).

## Notes
- Good news: embeddings work and ingestion continues, pacing Steam naturally. Open issue: the active model reports ctx=2048 in logs; if 8k is required, ensure the custom model is created/selected and allow a brief readiness window before probing.

# Part 11 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 4600–5000)

This slice captures a documentation-heavy subthread where the assistant proposed configuration and runtime changes (copying appsettings, longer timeouts, and optional chunking), and the user pushes back strongly against hidden fallbacks in favor of correctness-first behavior.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Make Development runs consistent (ensure appsettings are loaded when running Worker directly); propose long-text chunking + mean-pooling as a resiliency feature; user rejects silent fallbacks and insists on failing fast for correctness.
- Outcome: Agreement to keep correctness-first. Chunking must be explicit/opt-in; default behavior should throw when inputs exceed configured context.

## Verifiable Anchors (raw excerpts; ~L4600–L5000)
- Proposed ops notes (assistant):
  - “Copies appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json to the output directory.”
  - “Added chunking + mean-pooling to support >context inputs and reduce retries/timeouts on long texts.”
  - “How to re-run safely … DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT=Development dotnet run … --ollama-model=nomic-embed-8k:latest --emb-num-ctx=8192 …”
  - “Optional: Pre-create the 8k model once … ollama create nomic-embed-8k:latest -f infrastructure/Modelfile.nomic-embed-8k”
- User rejection of silent fallbacks:
  - “I’m not sure that I love that … I would far rather the process not run instead of running, to completion, totally incorrectly … I care about programmatic correctness. Our program should not do incorrect stuff. Do not let that happen.”
- Assistant response (summarized intent captured in-thread):
  - Commit to correctness-first: make chunking opt-in (default off) and have inputs over context fail with a clear error; do not enable deterministic fallbacks; ensure timeouts and config loading are sane.

## Notes
- This aligns with the project’s philosophy: avoid “helpful” behavior that silently compromises correctness. If inputs don’t fit the configured context (2048 or 8192), fail fast unless the operator explicitly opts into chunking semantics.
- The re-run guidance documents the expected healthy logs when 8k is active: “embedding health OK (… model='nomic-embed-8k:latest', num_ctx=8192)”.

---

# Part 12 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 5000–5400)

This slice shows a fresh Ollama 0.12.3 session where embedding routes are working, but the active runtime context remains 2048 for the loaded model (base v1.5), despite having created a custom `nomic-embed-8k:latest`. The logs clearly record the 8192 request being reduced to 2048 at runtime.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Confirm embedding endpoints return 200; observe that `num_ctx=8192` is requested but the model runs with `n_ctx=2048` and issues a warning. Long-running `/api/embed` calls (seconds) appear as buffers grow, indicating real embedding work.
- Outcome: 8k tag exists, but the active load is still constrained to the base model’s 2048 ctx. Next steps require ensuring the custom tag is actually selected and honored.

## Verifiable Anchors (raw excerpts; ~L5000–L5400)
- Version and endpoint health:
  - “[GIN] … | 200 | … | GET "/api/version"” (0.12.3)
  - Multiple 200s for “POST "/api/embed"” with durations (1.04s, 8.74s, 23.38s, 28.12s) as buffers are reallocated: “output_reserve: reallocating output buffer … 0.12→0.60→5.25→30.68→43.33→45.83→61.11 MiB”.
- Model metadata and context evidence:
  - “general.name = nomic-embed-text-v1.5 … nomic-bert.context_length u32 = 2048 … embedding_length u32 = 768”.
  - Warning: “requested context size too large for model num_ctx=8192 n_ctx_train=2048”.
  - Runtime: “llama_context: n_ctx = 2048 … n_batch = 512 … llama runner started in 0.92 seconds”.
- High token count note:
  - “routes.go:658 … ctxLen=2046 tokenCount=2347” (confirms near-limit behavior vs requested 8192).

## Notes
- Embedding endpoints are healthy and producing 768-dim outputs, but 8k isn’t “active” at runtime. This suggests either:
  1) The custom tag was not the one actually invoked by the client, or
  2) The create-time `PARAMETER num_ctx 8192` isn’t applied when loading this GGUF (base model metadata/max remains in effect), leading to a clamp at 2048.
- A concrete proof step for the next slice: inspect `/api/show` for `nomic-embed-8k:latest` and compare with the client’s configured model name; issue a tiny `/api/embed` explicitly targeting the 8k tag and observe whether the warning persists.

# Part 13 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 5400–5800)

This slice continues the 0.12.3 host session, confirming repeated successful `/api/embed` calls with long durations and buffer growth while the runtime context remains fixed at 2048. One long-running embed ends with a 500 due to client aborts.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Sustained embedding traffic across multiple requests with 200s and sizable CPU buffer reallocations; explicit logs show `n_ctx=2048` and later client-initiated aborts (500) during a long embed call.
- Outcome: Confirms: (a) embeddings are functional; (b) host-side 0.12.3 keeps `n_ctx=2048` despite attempts to request 8192; (c) not a blocker for Bronze per se, but mismatched with the 8k goal.

## Verifiable Anchors (raw excerpts; ~L5400–L5800)
- Runner state and repeated embeds:
  - “llama runner started in 0.92 seconds … loaded runners count=1 … llama_context: n_ctx = 2048 … output buffer size = 0.12 MiB”
  - Repeated: “[GIN] … | 200 | 1.04s | POST "/api/embed"”, later “8.74s”, “23.38s”, “28.12s”, “14.76s” with many “output_reserve: reallocating output buffer … up to 61.11 MiB”.
- Client aborts leading to 500:
  - “aborting embedding request due to client closing the connection” (repeated) → “[GIN] … | 500 | 22.26s | POST "/api/embed"”.
- Tags/show activity:
  - “[GIN] … | 200 | … | GET "/api/tags"” and “POST "/api/show"” interleaved with embeds.

## Notes
- The traffic patterns show real embedding work even at 2k ctx. The mismatch with the desired 8k remains unresolved in this host session.
- The next slice will switch context to the AppHost (container) run, which pins ollama/ollama:0.3.12 and shows the runner starting with “--ctx-size 8192” and `llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx = 8192`.

---

# Part 14 — 2025-09-28 (Conversation 9: Lines 5800–end)

This final slice captures the Aspire/AppHost run against the pinned container image `ollama/ollama:0.3.12`, where the ensure-model sequence executes, the runner is launched with `--ctx-size 8192 --embedding`, and the internal logs show `llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx = 8192`. Embedding probes return 200 quickly. The Worker subsequently struggles with Cosmos initialization and then begins Steam requests.

## Quick Orientation
- Focus: Validate 8k context in the containerized Ollama; observe successful `/api/embed` immediately afterward; then note Cosmos init failures (NullReference during CreateDatabaseIfNotExists) and eventual Steam traffic.
- Outcome: Confirms 8k is genuinely active under AppHost 0.3.12; the remaining failures are not in embeddings but in Cosmos wiring and later Steam pacing.

## Verifiable Anchors (raw excerpts; ~L5800–end)
- Container startup + version:
  - “Listening on [::]:11434 (version 0.3.12)” and dynamic library checks (cpu_avx, cuda_v11/v12) on startup.
- Ensure-model and embeds:
  - “[GIN] | 404 | … | POST "/api/show"” (before create)
  - “POST "/api/pull" … 200” then “POST "/api/create" … 200”
  - Runner launch: “starting llama server … --ctx-size 8192 --batch-size 512 --embedding …”
  - Internal: “llm_load_print_meta … n_ctx_train = 2048 …” then
    - “llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx = 8192 … KV self size = 288.00 MiB … model loaded … request … path="/embedding" status=200”
  - Gateway: “[GIN] … | 200 | 1.19s | POST "/api/embed"”
- Worker perspective:
  - Logs: “Ollama server version: {"version":"0.3.12"} … embeddings via /api/embed (dims=768, batch=1) … embedding health OK (… model='nomic-embed-8k:latest', num_ctx=8192) on attempt 1. Proceeding with ingestion.”
- Post-embed issues (not embeddings):
  - Cosmos init attempts 1–12: “Object reference not set to an instance of an object” from CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync with detailed diagnostics frames.
  - Steam traffic thereafter: “ISteamApps/GetAppList … 200 … appreviews … 200 …”

## Notes
- This provides the crucial contrast: host 0.12.3 session held at 2k ctx, while AppHost 0.3.12 shows true 8k context active and healthy embeds.
- The main next steps outside summarization: (a) normalize the Worker to target the AppHost Ollama endpoint in dev runs to leverage the known-good 0.3.12 path; (b) add a minimal readiness poll after `/api/create` to avoid early 404s/timeout; (c) fix Cosmos init NREs before resuming Bronze at scale; (d) maintain correctness-first (no chunking by default).

---

## Completion Summary (Day 9)

- What went wrong:
  - Embedding endpoints frequently 404’d immediately after model create; early probes hit client-side 10s timeouts, even canceling model loads (499s). Host Ollama (0.12.3) held runtime context at 2k despite 8k requests.
- What we verified:
  - The ensure-model flow (show → pull → create) works. Once the runner is fully ready, both `/api/embeddings` and `/api/embed` return 200. In the AppHost-pinned container (0.3.12), `llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx = 8192` confirms genuine 8k operation and quick 200s on `/api/embed`.
- Why Steam churn happened:
  - When embeddings were not ready, the Worker retried and then proceeded to Steam, causing 429s; when embeddings are active, their latency naturally paces Steam.
- Configuration stance reaffirmed:
  - Single source (AppHost env) for `Ollama:Endpoint`, `Ollama:Model=nomic-embed-8k:latest`, `Embeddings:NumCtx=8192`. Bind to strongly-typed options in the Worker; avoid magic strings.
- Correctness-first policy locked:
  - No hidden chunking/deterministic fallbacks. If text exceeds configured context, fail fast unless explicitly opted into chunking.

## Fast Verification Checklist (post-Day 9)
- Ollama readiness + 8k proof:
  - POST `/api/show { name: "nomic-embed-8k:latest" }` → 200; runner logs include “--ctx-size 8192” and “llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx = 8192”.
  - POST `/api/embed` with a tiny input → 200, vector length 768.
- Worker endpoint normalization:
  - Confirm the Worker uses the AppHost internal endpoint in Dev (no host-local 0.12.3 by mistake).
- Readiness poll:
  - After create, poll `/api/show` until present; do one warm-up embed before health check.
- Cosmos init:
  - Address the CreateDatabaseIfNotExists NullReference before large bronze runs.
