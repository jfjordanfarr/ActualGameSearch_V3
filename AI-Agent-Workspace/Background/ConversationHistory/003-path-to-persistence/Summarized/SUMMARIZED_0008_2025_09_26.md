This reconstructs Conversation 8 as a single, interleaved, fact-checked timeline tied to the raw log at `ConversationHistory/003-path-to-persistence/Raw/0008_2025_09_26.md`. Each turn captures summary, verbatim anchors (with raw line references), and correlated commits within a widened UTC window.

## Quick Synopsis (High-Level Orientation)
Use this for fast rehydration; per-turn provenance and artifacts follow.

### Major Arcs
- **Conversation Summarization**: Creation of SUMMARIZED_0007_2025_09_24.md following established provenance patterns.
- **Copilot Instructions Refinement**: Streamlined copilot-instructions.md from verbose, summarization-focused content back to lean outer-shell guidance; preserved .NET 10 migration stance; clarified spec-kit boundaries.
- **Data Ownership Strategy**: Explicit R2-first architecture to avoid vendor lock-in; Cloudflare R2 as canonical data lake, Azure Cosmos as serving layer; rclone with ephemeral env-var mode for secure, secret-free syncing.
- **Bronze Tier Scale-Up**: Implemented resumable Bronze ingestion with persistent run-state; CLI with flags for sample size, per-app caps, news collection (all tags by default), and concurrency controls.
- **Steam API Etiquette**: Major 429 rate-limiting issues resolved with Retry-After-aware exponential backoff, cursor-sticky review paging, and single-connection politeness; reduced concurrency to 1 by default.
- **Compute Optimization**: Gated expensive game description embeddings to titles with ≥20 reviews to focus on likely Gold candidates.
- **AppHost Integration**: Worker bronze mode via environment variable passthrough; VS Code task for background ingestion; fixed data output path pollution.
- **Structured Telemetry**: Wired OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT for proper logs/traces/metrics export to Aspire dashboard.

- **Scale vision**: Bronze 2000/Silver 2000/Gold 200 items per game (reviews/news/workshop); census approach.
- **Assistant**: Hardens script to never print secrets; adjusts news collection to "all" by default (no tag filtering).

### Turn 11 — Bronze Implementation & 429 Issues (L2714–L2951)
- **User**: Excited about background compute usage in Codespaces; requests persistent run-state.
- **Assistant**: Implements file-backed RunStateTracker with --resume capability; enhanced CLI with comprehensive flags.

- **Run state**: `.../runstate/{runId}.json` (persistent resume capability)

## Data Ownership Architecture (R2-First)
- **Canonical lake**: Cloudflare R2 (zero public egress, S3-compatible)
- **Serving layer**: Azure Cosmos DB (Gold subset + embeddings)
- **Backup strategy**: rclone with ephemeral env-var mode; export/import tar.zst archives
- **Cost model**: R2 storage + ops; Azure ingress free; Cosmos RU for serving
- **Portability**: S3-compatible APIs; local-first development; vendor-neutral tooling

## Steam API Etiquette (Final State)
- **Concurrency**: Default to 1 (overridable via CLI flags)
- **Backoff**: Exponential with jitter; honors Retry-After headers for 429/503
- **Review paging**: Cursor-sticky on 429 (retry same page, don't skip)
- **Connection limits**: MaxConnectionsPerServer=1 per named HttpClient
- **Politeness**: 25-95ms jitter between operations; circuit breaker for persistent issues

## Behavioral Guidance Distilled
- **Data ownership first**: Local filesystem canonical; cloud DBs are derivatives; S3-compatible mirroring; avoid vendor traps.
- **Steam API kindness**: Single connection; honor Retry-After; cursor-sticky paging; exponential backoff with jitter.
- **Compute optimization**: Gate expensive operations (embeddings) to high-signal candidates (≥20 reviews).
- **Resumability**: Persistent run-state for long operations; graceful handling of Codespaces timeouts.
- **Telemetry hygiene**: Structured logs/traces via OTEL; dashboard monitoring over terminal spam.
- **Secret management**: Environment variables only; never write to files; ephemeral remotes for cloud syncing.
