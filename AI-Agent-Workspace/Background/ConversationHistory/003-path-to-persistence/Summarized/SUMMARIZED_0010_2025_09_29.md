# Fact-Checked, Interleaved Timeline — 2025-09-29 (Conversation 10)

This reconstructs Day 10 as an auditable, interleaved summary tied to the raw log at `ConversationHistory/003-path-to-persistence/Raw/0010_2025_09_29.md` (6.2k+ lines). Claims are grounded with short verbatim-style references and approximate raw line hints.

## Quick Synopsis
- Ritual upheld: before new engineering, complete Day 9’s auditable summary in careful, small slices to avoid autosummarization churn.
- Documentation push: created a single-source “Requirements Canon” and kicked off a structured Vision → Requirements → Architecture → Units audit.
- Spec-kit alignment: captured 5 clarifications (CQ1–CQ5), resolved a duplicate FR ID, added/renumbered tasks, and encoded a fallback policy for Bronze candidacy when `recommendations.total` is missing.
- Embeddings correctness: host Ollama 0.12.3 kept enforcing 2048 context; we affirmed this silently corrupts semantics. Agreed on mitigation order 3 > 2 > 1: (3) fail fast when ctx < requested, (2) fix host to 8k if possible, (1) otherwise use AppHost’s known-good 8k container.
- Outcome: Day 9 summary completed end-to-end (Parts 1–14). Repo docs/specs materially improved. Bronze ingestion ran in standalone mode but confirmed 2k ctx; team rejected it as “appears to work” while silently wrong.

## Key User Intent Anchors (raw line hints)
- (~L1–L30) Kickoff: “we start by summarizing the past workday’s chat… two major things today: consolidate requirements into stable docs; and a janitorial pass.”
- (~L85–L110) “Zero code changes until the Day 9 summary is in place” (pause/revert edits; proceed in small bites to avoid autosummarization).
- (~L1100–L1650) Interleaved additions of Day 9 Parts 3–8; continued in small slices.
- (~L1700–L2400) Increase to ~400-line slices; complete Day 9 Parts 11–14 through end.
- (~L2400–L3000) Repository audit: update gitignore-aware tree tool; create Vision/Requirements/Architecture/Units skeleton; start “Requirements Canon.”
- (~L3000–L3600) Clarifications (CQ1–CQ5); user answers B for fallback; request to update spec-kit accordingly.
- (~L3600–L4400) Spec-kit updates: clarifications recorded; FR renumbering; tasks added; data-model notes; CLI contract doc updated.
- (~L4400–L5200) Standalone Bronze attempt: embeddings work but ctx=2048; user calls this “silent corruption” (reject as success).
- (~L5200–end) Mitigation ordering agreed: 3 > 2 > 1; begin design for fail-fast context validation in health check.

## Turn-by-Turn Highlights (interleaved; verifiable excerpts)

1) Summarization-first and scope for Day 10 — (~L1–L120)
- User: Reaffirms cadence. Day 10 mission: understand what went wrong on Day 9 and fix comprehensively; consolidate requirements and clean workspace.
- Excerpt: “two major things today… combine requirements/vision/user stories into stable docs… janitorial pass.”
- Outcome: Assistant commits to producing Day 9 summary first, then proceed with docs and hygiene.

2) Day 9 summary (Parts 1–2) and “no edits yet” enforcement — (~L120–L280)
- Assistant: Writes Part 1 (L1–199) and Part 2 (L200–800) for Day 9, matching the established format (Quick Synopsis, Interleaved timeline, Artifact Index, Verification).
- User: Enforces no code changes until summaries complete; proceed in “small bites” to avoid context autosummarization.

3) Parts 3–4 of Day 9: Ollama regressions and pausing edits — (~L280–L520)
- Assistant: Adds Parts 3–4 (L800–end), documenting 404s/timeouts on `/api/embeddings`/`/api/embed`, ensure-model flow (show → pull → create), and config/alignment debates.
- Outcome: Clear documentation of readiness race, endpoint mismatch hypotheses, and pause-on-edits directive.

4) Small-slice continuation: Parts 5–8 — (~L520–L1000)
- Assistant: Appends Parts 5–7 (L3200–4000) and Part 8 (L4000–4200) in tight slices with [GIN] snippets from container logs and Worker HTTP traces.
- Outcome: Establishes a reproducible pattern: probes 404 immediately after create, then 200s once runner is ready; client 10s timeout sometimes aborts first load.

5) Completing Day 9: Parts 9–14 — (~L1000–L1600)
- Assistant: Adds Parts 9–10 (L4200–4600) and then 11–14 (L4600–end). Key findings:
	- Host Ollama 0.12.0/0.12.3: embeddings 200s but ctx=2048 enforced; warnings about requested 8192 vs trained 2048.
	- AppHost Ollama 0.3.12: runner shows `n_ctx=8192`; `/api/embed` 200s; after that Worker hits Cosmos init NREs and Steam requests proceed.
- Outcome: Day 9 summary complete; confirms the 8k vs 2k bifurcation and readiness/timeout races.

6) Repo audit kickoff: multi-.gitignore tree + doc skeleton — (~L1600–L1900)
- Assistant: Updates `tree_gitignore.py` to respect multiple local .gitignores, runs a top-level scan, and creates a skeleton “Repository-Documentation-Audit-2025-09-29.md” with Vision → Requirements → Architecture → Units.
- Outcome: Baseline audit doc exists; plan to expand with config keys and readiness flow notes.

7) “Requirements Canon” creation and source sweep — (~L1900–L2300)
- Assistant: Reads existing summaries and spec-kit docs, then creates `Requirements-Canon.md` consolidating vision, functional/non-functional requirements, policies (correctness-first, ask-Steam-once), and user stories.
- Outcome: Single-source reference to keep chats grounded, with sources anchored to spec-kit and summarized logs.

8) Analyze + Clarify: 5 questions to close spec gaps — (~L2300–L2900)
- Assistant: Runs the analyze flow (read-only) and proposes 5 clarifying questions (CQ1–CQ5) covering catalog enumeration, policy metadata schema, tiered review extension stage, news taxonomy scope, and “true game” grouping heuristics.
- User responses:
	- CQ1: Use official Steam app list endpoint; no Bronze exclusions beyond inclusion policy.
	- CQ2: Open to proposed PolicyMetadata fields.
	- CQ3: Prefer Silver as default stage for review-extension deltas (Gold may still extend if needed).
	- CQ4: No filtering in Bronze; discovery census first; taxonomy refined in Silver.
	- CQ5: Grouping unknown; treat as Silver research/annotation; ingest DLC metadata to learn.
- Outcome: Concrete direction to encode in spec-kit docs.

9) Spec-kit updates and task coverage — (~L2900–L3600)
- Assistant: Applies doc-only updates:
	- spec.md: Adds “Session 2025‑09‑29” clarifications, encodes FR‑028F fallback (use review_count ≥ min when recommendations missing), renumbers duplicate FR‑028 (Git Scope → FR‑035), updates FR‑023 to put review-extension at Silver by default, clarifies FR‑031 (Bronze no filter; Silver discovery-first taxonomy).
	- plan.md: Notes catalog via Steam list; Silver default for review extension; Bronze avoids exclusions beyond inclusion policy.
	- tasks.md: Adds T012a CatalogEnumerator; T015a FR‑028F fallback + logging; T017a Silver ReviewDeltaExtender; T019a news census/classify; T019b Workshop ingestion; T019c “true game” grouping research; T027 retention w/ guardrails; T028 PolicyMetadata persisted; fixes duplicate task ID.
	- data-model.md: Adds PolicyMetadata block shape (policy_version; thresholds; fallback_reason; effective_values; sample_counts) and a minimal newsClass.
	- contracts/worker-cli.md: Adds `--catalog`; clarifies outputs and Silver review extension behavior.
	- quickstart.md and research.md adjusted to reflect new flow and artifacts.
- Outcome: Spec-kit is aligned with CQ1–CQ5 and now testable; coverage gaps and duplicates addressed.

10) Bronze standalone run and correctness stance — (~L3600–L4300)
- Assistant: Runs Worker standalone with host Ollama 0.12.3; embeddings return 200s but server logs show `n_ctx=2048` with “requested context too large” warning.
- User: Rejects this as success: “appearing to work” while truncating ~75% of semantic content is unacceptable.
- Outcome: Decision to treat 2k enforcement as a failure for our use-case; avoid silent corruption.

11) Mitigation order and embedding validation design — (~L4300–end)
- User: Sets order 3 > 2 > 1:
	1) Fail fast when actual ctx < requested (prevent silent corruption).
	2) If feasible, fix host to true 8k.
	3) Else, pivot to AppHost’s 8k container (known-good).
- Assistant: Locates embedding health check and `EmbeddingUtils` guardrails; proposes augmenting health to determine actual ctx (via `/api/show` parameters first, then model_info context_length) and compare to `Embeddings:NumCtx`. If mismatch, abort with explicit error.
- Outcome: Implementation deferred to next engineering step; doc intent captured.

## Fast Verification Commands (optional)
- Confirm Day 9 summary completion:
	- `grep -n "Part 14" AI-Agent-Workspace/Background/ConversationHistory/003-path-to-persistence/Summarized/SUMMARIZED_0009_2025_09_28.md`
- List all summarized conversation files (slick helper):
	- `find AI-Agent-Workspace/Background/ConversationHistory -path "*/Summarized/SUMMARIZED_*.md" -type f | sort -t/ -k6 -V | awk -F/ '{spec=$(NF-2); file=$(NF); gsub(/SUMMARIZED_|\.md/, "", file); printf "%-25s %s\n", spec":", file}'`

	- `python AI-Agent-Workspace/Scripts/tree_gitignore.py /workspaces/ActualGameSearch_V3 | head -n 50`

## Notes and Next Steps
- Embeddings correctness (highest priority):
	1) Fail-fast in Worker if actual ctx < requested (determine via `/api/show` parameters → `num_ctx`; fallback to `model_info.context_length`). Abort ingestion; include a clear log and PolicyMetadata note.
	2) Attempt host-side fix to 8k (recreate model, confirm via logs and health check; if still 2k enforced, proceed to #3).
	3) Use AppHost’s Ollama 0.3.12 container (known-good 8k). Keep config single-sourced; bind via typed options.
- Execute newly added tasks:
	- T012a CatalogEnumerator; T015a Bronze fallback + policy logging; T017a Silver review extender; T019a–c news census/classify and grouping research; T027 retention guardrails; T028 PolicyMetadata persisted in run-summary/manifests.
- Expand the audit doc with a configuration keys table (Ollama:Endpoint/Model, Embeddings:NumCtx; Bronze thresholds) and a short “embedding readiness workflow” diagram.

## Completion Summary
- Day 9 summary: Completed end-to-end with interleaved, auditable Parts 1–14.
- Day 10 outputs: Requirements Canon created; repo audit doc scaffolded; spec-kit updated with clarifications, fallback policy, tasks, and schema notes; multi-.gitignore tree tool improved.
- Critical stance: Rejected 2k-context embeddings as “appears to work” but semantically wrong; agreed mitigation order (3 > 2 > 1) with fail-fast first.

## Part 2 — Late-session breakthroughs (Raw ~L2000–end)

This addendum captures the final ~1.2k lines of Day 10 where the embedding context issue was conclusively solved, verified in both standalone and AppHost modes, documented, and committed.

### What changed
- Fixed validation bug: `GetActualOllamaContextAsync` now checks `parameters` first (runtime config with `num_ctx 8192`) and only falls back to `model_info.context_length` (base 2048). This prevents false failures when 8k is actually active.
- AppHost success: Running under Aspire (Ollama 0.3.12 container) showed:
	- `--ctx-size 8192` in the runner command line.
	- `llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx = 8192` in logs.
	- `/api/embed` consistently returning 200 with dims=768.
	- Worker logs: `DEBUG: actualContext=8192, embNumCtx=8192` → “Context validation passed.”
- Standalone success path: With `INGESTION__REQUIRECOSMOS=false`, the Worker’s embedding health check and ingestion proceed; when Cosmos is required, the Worker aborts early (by design) after validation to avoid upstream churn.
- Definitive documentation: Authored `AI-Agent-Workspace/Docs/ollama-8k-context-solution.md` with TL;DR, root cause, code fix, run modes, success indicators (300–700ms), and troubleshooting.
- Copilot instructions link: Added a persistent link and “Never lose this again!” affordance to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` so future sessions can rehydrate instantly.
- Commit + push: Changes were committed to branch `003-path-to-persistence` and pushed.

### Evidence anchors (verbatim-style)
- AppHost logs (Ollama 0.3.12):
	- `starting llama server … --ctx-size 8192 … --embedding …`
	- `llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx = 8192`
	- `[GIN] … 200 … POST "/api/embed"`
- Worker logs:
	- `Ollama embedding health OK (dims=768, model='nomic-embed-8k:latest', num_ctx=8192) on attempt 1.`
	- `DEBUG: actualContext=8192, embNumCtx=8192` → `Context validation passed. Proceeding with ingestion.`
	- Cosmos not ready path: `Cosmos DB is not available and Ingestion:RequireCosmos=true. Aborting…` (correct behavior to prevent waste and 429s).
- Performance: Embedding requests observed at 300–700ms, matching the expected cost of processing full 8k context (vs ~50ms when truncated at 2k).

### Artifacts in this late segment
- Code
	- `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/Program.cs` — Enhanced validation to prioritize runtime parameters; improved logging.
	- `src/ActualGameSearch.Worker/appsettings.json` — Structure alignment with `Ollama:Model`/`Embeddings:NumCtx` to avoid defaulting.
- Docs
	- `AI-Agent-Workspace/Docs/ollama-8k-context-solution.md` — Definitive guide, validated on 2025‑09‑30.
	- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Link added in the Workspace Orientation section.
- Version control
	- Commit pushed to `003-path-to-persistence` summarizing the fix and documentation.

### Optional verification
- Runtime parameters preferred over base metadata:
	- `POST /api/show { name: "nomic-embed-8k:latest" }` → confirm `.parameters` contains `num_ctx 8192`.
- AppHost readiness and 8k confirmation:
	- Grep container logs for `--ctx-size 8192` and `llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx = 8192`.
- Worker validation log line:
	- Look for `DEBUG: actualContext=8192, embNumCtx=8192` and `Context validation passed.`
- Documentation presence:
	- Confirm `AI-Agent-Workspace/Docs/ollama-8k-context-solution.md` exists and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` contains a link to it.

### Closing note
With the 8k embedding path stabilized and documented, Day 11 can focus on an extended Bronze run (to characterize throughput/latency) while parallelizing either frontend work or ingestion scaling experiments. The “fast-fail on context mismatch” guardrail ensures we never silently regress to 2k again.
